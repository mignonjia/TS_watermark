It ranked the top applicants with post-Alice allowance withdrawals. Unsurprisingly IBM, eBay and Microsoft were the top three assignees, named in 47, 19 and 15 applications respectively. Perhaps more surprisingly, gaming companies IGT and WMS Gaming are in the top 10. Also appearing are finance companies JP Morgan, American Express and Bank of America, which reflects the impact of Alice on financial services patents.\nThe Supreme Court has declined to hear the appeal of a dispute over the copyright on Sherlock Holmes. On November 2 it left intact a ruling that 50 works by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle featuring the famous detective are in the public domain.\nDoyle\u2019s estate had been trying to get writer Leslie Klinger to pay a licence for using the Sherlock Holmes character in a compendium of new stories. A fee was paid for the first The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes but Klinger refused to pay a licence fee for the second installment.\nIn June, the Seventh Circuit ruled that the copyright on 46 stories and four novels featuring Holmes were in the public domain. In August, Judge Richard Posner ordered Doyle\u2019s estate to pay legal fees to Klinger and branded its demands \u201ca form of extortion\u201d.\nThe past week threw up a bizarre copyright question: can you copyright a backside? As reported in a post on The IPKat blog, Kim Kardashian believes fitness model Jen Selter is copying her poses when posting pictures of her backside on Instagram. Kardashian has reportedly asked her lawyers to investigate whether there is a copyright infringement.\nThe IPKat blog gave a detailed analysis of the issues involved, from an EU perspective at least.

{"prefix": "The Seven Cs of Political Leadership!\nAs I sit down on the eve of my 40th birthday to write this editorial, I couldn't have thought of writing on a more important aspect -- as great political leadership is what India requires more than anything else today.\nAs I sit down on the eve of my 40th birthday to write this editorial, I couldn't have thought of writing on a more important aspect -- as great political leadership is what India requires more than anything else today. And though I have written considerably on leadership, it has mainly been about corporate leadership.\nLeadership in corporations is massively different from political leadership, and therefore it requires a special model and a special line of thinking. While in corporations the final aim is profit maximisation in most cases, in politics the final objective is necessarily social welfare maximisation.\nWhile in corporations the best leaders are often the best marketing guys, in politics the best leaders necessarily have to be the people who are the sincerest and most hard working. While in business you can make do without the knowledge of economics, in politics that can be suicidal. While in business being unethical can harm you and at most your stake holders, in politics the lack of ethics ruins an entire nation's future.\nAnd most importantly, while in corporations leadership is about commitment to the strongest and survival of the fittest, in political leadership, the focus always is about commitment to the weakest and survival of the weakest. Thus, for me, political leadership is not just about having certain qualities but also simultaneously about not having various qualities. Rather, what is important is to ensure that one does not possess certain specific qualities first; if that is taken care of, the rest would then automatically fall in place.\nKeeping all the above in mind, I believe the model of the seven winning virtues of political leadership (viz credibility, compassion, clairvoyance, camaraderie, commitment, charisma and competence) that I have developed is most suited for Indian politicians in particular.\nWell, the difference in this model and any other such model is that in this model, each element or virtue is actually the opposite of one of the seven sins of life -- the seven deadly sins that we are supposed to avoid; to a large extent, as normal human beings and to an almost extreme extent, as a political leader! The first sin that a leader must avoid is that of greed. This is what seems to be the biggest problem with political leaders in India.

The second sin every politician needs to avoid is gluttony.\nThe next sin a leader must avoid is the sin of sloth. Sloth is being spiritually and emotionally apathetic and being physically and emotionally inactive. The fourth sin that leaders must avoid is envy. The fifth sin to avoid is the sin of lust. It refers to the way politicians have been doing things -- from threats to hide their lust filled deeds to even murders.\nThe sixth sin that political leaders need to avoid is the sin of pride! And that brings us to the final deadly sin that every political leader should avoid. The sin of wrath. This is what political leadership all about -- avoiding the seven keys sins and instead developing the seven winning virtues to lead their countries towards a better future. That's what great leaders were all about. Their lives are a lesson in avoiding the seven sins and delivering on the winning virtues! May a day come when Indian leaders are full of these seven virtues.", "no_wm_completion": " of all other countries is that they are so greedy in the pursuit of power, and they can't or don't want to give up all the power and privileges that they have to earn and achieve power. At the moment, only politicians seem to be so greedy and thus, to an extent, a lot of the development problem goes on with politicians. On a side note, politicians need to be able to develop a high degree of empathy.\nIn a normal human being, this should be enough for making a difference for the country; unfortunately, that is not how most of the politicians are.\nNext, the virtue of empathy. Empathy is absolutely the best virtue to have. When a citizen feels, in a natural way, for someone else than him or herself for that matter, his or her life becomes good. Empathy is also the virtue to have the most for any individual or group, even if, at a cost to oneself.

If this is observed, it is likely that people have concluded that no real competitive force could ever come between them and their own level of self-gratification, making that a kind of spiritual religion!\nThis is where the virtue of compassion comes in. I don't care if you are a businessman or a politician, any decent human being has to feel compassion towards other human beings. If for anyone it is really necessary to turn the other cheek, at least you would have to do so for someone who is not even your enemy, and certainly not to someone who is hurting your wife, child or loved one.\n"}
{"prefix": "When it comes to safety in the workplace, organizational culture can be quite literally a matter of life and death. Look no further than the example of BP.\nAs one of the world's largest oil producers, BP has a troubled safety record. As Forbes reports, one of BP's plants has an unusually tragic past, including an explosion in 2005 that killed 15 workers and injured 180. This plant also reported 23 worker fatalities in the three decades that preceded the 2005 accident.\nWhen Marathon Petroleum, the fourth-largest oil refiner in the U.S., bought the plant from BP, many in the industry thought it was a risky move. But Marathon had ideas for how to rectify the situation by instituting a culture centered on safety.\nRemedying the culture required a review of the plant's existing safety procedures. Following the 2005 explosion, federal investigators pointed to BP's problematic safety culture -- for example, with managers who were \"checking off boxes\" rather than promoting best practices for safety -- as the cause of the plant's many safety problems. BP failed to respond and paid dearly for its inaction in 2010, when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, killing 11 and spilling more than 3 million barrels of oil. The incident cost the company $54 billion in damages.\nAs BP's record illustrates, organizational culture matters a great deal to employee safety. Cultures in which employees are engaged in their work are safer places to work. Gallup's 2016 meta-analysis study -- which examined more than 82,000 business units and 1.8 million employees in 230 organizations, across 49 industries and in 73 countries -- shows that business units with engagement scores in the top quartile of Gallup's employee engagement database have 70% fewer safety incidents compared with bottom-quartile units.\nTheir employees are committed to doing quality work. When workers are committed to a standard of excellence in all they do, it's natural for them to adhere to best practices that prevent safety incidents. When employees are dedicated to quality, they go the extra mile to do things right the first time. By taking the right strategic action -- for example, by holding employees accountable for quality -- leaders can develop a workforce that makes smart decisions throughout the day and promotes a culture of workplace safety.\nThe mission or purpose of the company makes employees feel their job is important. Many of the world's most engaged organizations maintain a purpose-driven culture. Their leaders know why the company exists and ensure that employees understand and identify with that purpose. When workers embrace the mission of an organization and connect with that purpose both personally and professionally, they are more likely to think \"big picture\" in all areas of their work. Employees who are aligned with the company's mission are also more likely to approach their work with thoughtfulness and attention to detail, which contributes to a culture of safety.\nEmployees feel that their opinions count. It's a simple notion: Listen to workers who are closest to the action. These individuals offer a front-line perspective on organizational problems and often are well-versed in preventing and overcoming them. Leaders should encourage employees to watch for hazards and should make it easy for them to share their feedback and concerns. Most importantly, when leaders act on the information they receive, it demonstrates to employees that their opinions matter -- and it can help companies avoid preventable safety incidents.\nAn unsafe workplace can have far-reaching effects on a company and its employees. Productivity can suffer, and insurance claims can significantly damage a company's bottom line. But no company can quantify the cost of the most serious accidents. Any expenses to the business pale in comparison with the infinite cost to", "gold_completion": " the families of the individuals whose lives were tragically lost on the Deepwater Horizon or who were killed or injured in the BP refinery explosion.\nGiven the potential consequences of a safety incident, leaders can't afford to be haphazard about safety. Regardless of industry or company size, all businesses need to do everything in their power to develop an engaged workforce that is committed to avoiding safety incidents. This means ensuring that employees are committed to quality work, believe in their company's mission and purpose and are confident in expressing their opinions. To keep employees safe, leaders need to create a culture of safety.\nFor former BP employees, the Marathon Petroleum acquisition -- and the cultural changes that have followed -- may create a safer environment that is the difference between life and death.

We're going to operate it with the best safety and environmental skills available.\"\nStephanie Plowman contributed to the research in this article.", "no_wm_completion": " an individual who is injured or killed in a workplace incident.\nCultures in which employees feel engaged in their work are safer places to work.

{"prefix": "DJ Premier will be the first artist to release a single on the newly-revived imprint, in a nod to its early-1990s roots.\nPatrick Moxey, the founder of dance and electronic label Ultra Music, is going back to his roots with the relaunch of Payday Records, the classic hip-hop label he created in 1992 that served as the label home of artists like Gang Starr, Group Home, Jeru the Damaja and Showbiz & A.G., among others. As part of the company's revival, Moxey is teaming back up with DJ Premier for a new single, \"Our Streets\" feat. A$AP Ferg, set to drop tomorrow (Nov. 3).\nWhen Moxey first launched Payday 25 years ago, it was at the center of New York's golden age of hip-hop, with Premier heavily involved as one of the go-to producers and, alongside Guru in Gang Starr, key artists in the scene at the time. In 1995, Payday also released the first-ever single from Jay-Z, \"In My Lifetime,\" a year before his debut album Reasonable Doubt was released in June 1996, and released a slew of albums and singles from the likes of WC and the MAAD Circle, O.C. and UTD, Mos Def's first hip-hop group.\nAlongside Premier, Payday has deals with New Orleans MC Pell, Atlanta veteran OJ Da Juiceman, U.K. rapper Yung Fume and NYC collective Gloss Gang.\n\"Hip-hop has become a global language, and I think the new Payday is here to reflect that and to help bring a bunch of diverse and talented new artists to the world,\" Moxey tells Billboard. \"Our first signings are from four different cities: New York, Atlanta, New Orleans and London. That reflects the fact that we have one computer in front of us and that computer knows no borders.\"\nPayday will operate as a standalone label with the backing of Ultra's sales, marketing and promotions structure, with product management and A&R staff in New York and the U.K. and flexible deals for its artists. And in another nod to the label's roots, Neale Easterby, the CEO of Empire Artist Management who helped manage Gang Starr along with Moxey, will serve as the label's managing director in the U.K.\n\"Payday the label came out of my warehouse parties in the early '90s; we did De La Soul's first show, we did Rob Base's first show, Q-Tip would DJ,\" Moxey says. \"That was the excitement of that time. I think that still holds true today, but with a new generation. To have those moments to do the unexpected -- that's what we're looking to do.\"\n\"Patrick always had his ear to the street and it didn't take a lot of explaining the culture since he was so involved with so many aspects of it,\" DJ Premier said in a statement. \"Our memories of growing together [are] monumental, so relaunching Payday brings it all back to the roots of where our flight to success lifted off.\"", "gold_completion": "\nPayday is also the latest legacy label to be relaunched this year, following Capitol Music Group's resurrection of Priority Records -- itself an early-'90s hip-hop institution, which started with a focus on the West Coast -- in June, and Warner Music Group's relaunch of Asylum Records earlier this week. Moxey sees Payday as both a global hub for hip-hop and one that will reflect the cultural aspects of its original era, beyond just music.\n\"It was a magic time in New York,\" he says about the company's origins, \"at a moment when hip-hop was very cultural: it was about the music, it was about the photographers, it was about the video makers, Triple Five Soul, many different aspects of it. I think it's important that all of that gets emphasized, and we'll be paying special attention at Payday to not just music, but all the related strands of art that go with that real culture around it.\"", "no_wm_completion": "\nAs far as the music itself is concerned, Payday can tap some of the classic hip-hop artists who have made the jump over to the studio in recent years.

It was a special pie in that I had never heard of elderberries. Personally, I still think that they taste a little like blueberries. This fruit was amazing. Don\u2019t ever turn down an elderberry pie if you have an option to have a piece. I have found that these elderberries are not widely known, but everyone that I know that has tasted these berries has loved them. From what I can see over the years this elderberry is loved by a variety of different wildlife, which will provide some competition.\nFrom my own experience I can seriously say to my reader who asked me for help with this wonderful plant a person who wants to grow them in Summit County will have success with a modest amount of effort. The only trial is that there are 25 different species around the world and at least six different cultivars of Elderberries and each of these have different requirements to some extent.\nThere are a number of different nurseries in the area that do raise elderberries. I have grown two different elderberries in my yard with success over the years. For me I think of this plant as more of a medium to tall shrub because it can grow from 5 to 12 feet tall. This compound leaf shrub does the best in moist soils but will tolerate dry soil, soil pH does not have much effect on this shrub, but grows suckers very well, because it grows stolons like strawberries.\nYou will have to prune this shrub regularly for this plant to do well. Over the centuries elderberry has been grown in hedges to access the fruit. Challenges to elderberry are a variety of borers, cankers and leaf spots, which can be serious to these plants. If you wanted more elderberry plants, you can propagate them by cuttings and seeds.

What you can do is make a tea of the drupe or berry and some of the dried leaves as treatment even for the flu and other virus based diseases.\nAt the Kibbutz Aza in Israel many people in the Kibbutz came down with the flu so they tested Sambucol. Twenty percent of these flu sufferers showed significant relief of fever, muscle aches and other symptoms within 24 hours, 73 percent felt better after the second day, and in three days 90 percent were completely cured.\nMany cultures have used this elderberry or sambucus nigra fruit as a juice for treating tonsillitis. This sambucol stimulates the immune system and has shown success against Epstein-Barr, herpes, and even HIV. If you make a tea out of the dried leaves you may find help for arthritis, inflammation, viruses and cancer. The flavonoids in elderberries are high in anti-oxidants such as vitamin C, which has 87 percent of the RDA, Vitamin A with 17 percent RDA, and includes iron, potassium, vitamin B6 and lots of beta carotene. Flowers from the elderberry can be used as an antiseptic wash or poultice to treat wounds or eye inflammations.\nElderberries are also a favorite among many birds for many reasons.

{"prefix": "As the Obama administration winds down more than a decade of war, the budget request \u2014 only fragments of which were released Thursday \u2014 is supposed to account for cuts of $487 billion in projected spending over the next 10 years.\nPentagon officials said their proposal represented tough choices, but the biggest cuts appeared to be in the Defense Department's plan to reduce the number of U.S. ground forces to slightly more than on Sept. 10, 2001, before the wars began.\nAt the same time, the department proposed increasing spending on technology and major weapons systems, after a strategic announcement earlier this month in which defense officials said they must be ready for all kinds of warfare and proposed greater use of unmanned aircraft and a more agile ground force.\nIt wants to raise spending on drones by 30 percent, delay spending on the costly and controversial F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and fund a new bomber and a sea-based vessel that would allow drones and helicopters to take off from international waters. It wants to maintain current spending levels on missile defense and nuclear weapons while increasing spending on cybersecurity.\nTthe department sought to assert that it was simultaneously taking risks and not losing any conventional capability. It said it was responding to growing fiscal pressures because this proposal represented the biggest cut it had made in a decade.\nTheir proposal, officials have said, carries risks because the U.S. military no longer would be able to fight two wars simultaneously and might be required to make difficult decisions about military priorities.\n\"The primary risk lies not in what we can do but in how much we can do and how fast we can do it,\" said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nFor the 2013 fiscal year, the department requests a $525 billion base budget \u2014 a $6 billion decrease from the current budget \u2014 and an additional $88.4 billion in supplemental funding for the war in Afghanistan, down from $115 billion this year.\nFor 2014, the request for the base budget \u2014 which excludes war spending \u2014 jumps to $534 billion; by fiscal year 2017 it reaches $567 billion.\nThe department, which expanded the size of its ground forces quickly over the past decade to support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, plans to cut the Army by 2017 to 490,000 soldiers from the current 562,000. Over the same period, the Marines would shrink by 20,000 to 182,000.\nThat would still leave a larger military than before the wars started. In 2001, there were 480,000 soldiers and 180,000 Marines.\nIn line with the smaller forces, the Pentagon calls for retiring planes that transport troops, including 27 C-5As and 65 C-130s. The budget also proposes modest limits on pay raises that would take effect in 2015 \u2014 after the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan is expected to be over \u2014 and increases in health care premiums.\nPanetta said the administration would ask Congress to authorize another round of cuts at U.S. military bases through the base realignment and closure process, which was last employed in 2005. He didn't offer specifics.\nRegardless, the suggestion alone could spark outrage on Capitol Hill, especially in an election year. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Thursday that he wouldn't support closing domestic bases before U.S. bases in Europe were shuttered.\nRep. William \"Mac\" Thornberry, R-Texas, called the proposal for a new BRAC round \"ridiculous, and there is likely little support in Congress for such a thing, on either side of the aisle or either side of the Capitol. It will cause disruptions across the services, yet offer little in terms of", "gold_completion": " savings.\"\nAnnouncing the results of a strategic review last month, the Defense Department said it would increase its focus on Asia. Its budget proposal reflects that, with spending for an 11th aircraft carrier and weapons system that could respond to China's growing military strength.\nThe department said it planned to cut two brigades from Europe and, according to Panetta, commit more troops to Asia, but he didn't offer specifics Thursday.\nThe department plans to save billions more by delaying production of the F-35, the most expensive weapons program in U.S. history. Bloomberg News reported that the projected expenditure on the system would be $9.2 billion, which would buy 29 of the fighters, 13 fewer than initially planned.\nOfficials said they hoped that the delay would give developers time to correct the myriad technical problems plaguing the program. But experts warn that prolonging production could raise its costs.\nThe Obama administration is expected to announce its full 2013 budget proposal in early February.", "no_wm_completion": " additional modernization at these places.\"\nStill, the department's proposal would bring a total of some 437,000 defense jobs to \"deficit-neutral,\" or offset by other savings.\nThe proposal includes $23 billion in savings through measures including \"early termination\" pay, less overtime, use of private contractors and reductions in overseas posts. It also includes $10.8 billion for the war on terror and $11 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, including another $4 billion to counter terrorist threats in the U.S. that the Pentagon sees as growing from Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThe Pentagon proposes another $30 billion in cost savings for the Air Force, including by downsizing or canceling plans for the F-35 fighter, which the Pentagon estimates could cost $700 billion over the next 30 years. The Air Force counters that it already has a replacement ready.\nDespite the budget cuts, the department remains committed in its long-term goal of spending at least 2.6", "gen_completion": " additional military readiness.\"\nBut it also is likely to stoke debate in Congress, particularly over how to close some $50 billion worth of bases and realign the Air Force to keep up with the growing needs of the Pentagon.\nThornberry is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, which oversees the military budget, and his committee could be the first to hold hearing hearings about the war on terror and the Pentagon spending plan.\nThornberry said he would be interested in hearing more about where troops would be stationed and a \"realistic plan\" to \"keep these bases alive.\"\n\"Given that a lot of folks probably live in the Air Force, Army and Marines and are really, really attached to the bases, it's very important to know that the war has continued,\" Thornberry said. \"If you're going to send a new commander in Afghanistan, you have to be there.\"\n--\nAssociated Press writer Ken Thomas contributed to this report.

If many of them took advantage, Facebook\u2019s stock could decline, because the market would be flooded with shares.\nIt's not yet known whether any of those investors had sold any stock because they have three business days to disclose sales, said Sam Hamadeh, the CEO of PrivCo, which researches privately held companies.\nBut many of them likely did, he said. \"A lot of people have been waiting,\" Hamadeh said. \"Facebook was expected to go public a long time ago.\"\nVenture capitalists who invested in Facebook as early as 2005 were likely itching to sell at the earliest opportunity.

The announcement marked the start of the country\u2019s first Ebola outbreak since the historically unprecedented West African epidemic that infected 28,000 people between 2014 and 2016, and killed more than 11,000.\nBut after just 42 days, it was all over.\nWith the last confirmed patient having tested negative for the virus for the second time in a row, the WHO declared an end to the outbreak on Sunday. Just four people had died, and just four more had become infected.\nBut just as importantly, once the first cases were confirmed, the response was fast, decisive, and coordinated\u2014all qualities that were initially missing in West Africa. The DRC response shows that when everything goes right, Ebola can be quickly brought to heel, even when it hits poor, remote places. \u201cWith the end of this epidemic, DRC has once again proved to the world that we can control the very deadly Ebola virus if we respond early in a coordinated and efficient way,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO\u2019s new Director-General, in a statement.\nThe symptoms of Ebola are greatly exaggerated in the popular press. It\u2019s not a disease of apocalyptic hemorrhaging from every orifice, and symptoms can easily be mistaken for other maladies. In this case, the first patient\u2014a 45-year-old man who contracted the virus on 22 April\u2014initially went to see a traditional healer. When that didn\u2019t work, he took a taxi to a health center\u2014and died on the way. (Both the driver, and a third individual who cared for the man, also eventually died.) The center quickly suspected Ebola and immediately sent samples to a national laboratory in Kinshasa. The staff there had the right knowledge, training, and connections\u2014they ran some preliminary tests while also calling international colleagues. Rimoin flew over with the latest diagnostics.\nAfter the first positive case was confirmed, the government immediately notified the WHO, which activated their emergency protocols. That inaccessibility of Likati was both a blessing and a curse\u2014it made it harder for the virus to spread, but also harder for health workers to reach the infected zone. Fortunately, after the sluggish response to the West African Ebola epidemic, the WHO had set up a $41 million contingency fund to ensure that money would be readily available for future emergencies. This fund allowed them and other organizations to quickly rent helicopters for flying personnel, generators, and supplies into Likati. \u201cWithin 24 hours, we could start airlifting,\u201d says Ibrahima-Soce Fall, director of the health security and emergencies cluster at the WHO\u2019s African office.\nThe team set up a base camp and", "gold_completion": " field lab in the grounds of a former convent. Health workers immediately started tracking anyone who had contact with infected individuals, eventually tracing 583 such contacts. There weren\u2019t any good maps of the area, so the volunteers used their cellphones to start charting the region. They spread out through the region\u2019s villages to improve accessibility by fixing bridges and forest tracks. With training from UNICEF and the WHO, they taught local communities how to stop Ebola from spreading, how to safely bury people who die from the disease, and how to disinfect affected homes.\nThe outbreak may be over, but the response continues. For the next 90 days, the WHO will continue to strengthen health services in the region, to ensure that local volunteers are trained to spot possible symptoms should the disease arise again. That, after all, is what preparedness is all about. A country\u2019s ability to control diseases in a crisis depends on everything that it sets in place during peace-time.", "no_wm_completion": " began running tests. The test results were processed and results are announced in about two days, so the team knew it would be safe to send the patient to a hospital in nearby Beni. By the time they left the region on 7 May, an initial team of 14 had flown into Beni and taken on 10 patients. With a second team on the way, they would have a total of 20, all of them in a small hospital in Beni itself.\nThere are no other Ebola outbreaks on the entire continent. No other DRC outbreak has even been reported by the country\u2019s healthcare system; it is one of the few places left in the world where the disease can be successfully controlled. And the country\u2019s history teaches that when Ebola strikes, it often strikes faster, steeper, and more viciously that in West Africa.\n\u201cYou might say it\u2019s too late,\u201d Dr Fall says, \u201cbut with better infrastructure and better control", "gen_completion": " began running PCR tests there; in under 24 hours, results from 36 tests came back positive. \u201cWe were able to move rapidly\u2014the process had been streamlined,\u201d says Fall.

{"prefix": "For decades, U.S. schools have failed to provide students with an adequate civics education, which is integral to building and maintaining an engaged and informed voting population.\nHow bad is it? According to the 2018 Annenberg Constitution Day Civics Survey, only 32 percent of Americans can name all three branches of the U.S. government. Even worse, 33 percent could not correctly name one branch.\nUnfortunately, this lack of basic civics knowledge is not restricted to U.S. adults. In 2014, only 23 percent of American students earned a proficient score on the civics portion of the \u201cNation\u2019s Report Card\u201d exam. Needless to say, this does not bode well for the future.\nGiven these startling statistics, one would assume that American educators would be working feverishly to find new ways to improve civics courses. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case. Only nine states and the District of Columbia require a full year of civics education as a requirement for high school graduation. Thirty-one states require students enroll in only one half-year course.\nAlthough several solutions have been proposed by educators and researchers to solve the civics crisis, none have been widely adopted. One of the most significant civics-related proposals is to require all high school students to pass the U.S. citizenship test, the same test that all immigrants must earn a passing score on before becoming a citizen. Although the movement started with much fanfare, it has since fizzled out; only 17 states have such a requirement.\nSchools are failing miserably to educate millions of Americans in basic civics. However, all is not lost. With a few reasonable changes, a civics education Renaissance is more than attainable.\nAs a former public high school teacher, one who taught courses in both American government and U.S. history, I have firsthand experience in the civics classroom crisis. Like many who have taught these courses before, I believe it is virtually impossible to provide children with the civics education they need in an eight-week civics \u201ccrash course.\u201d It\u2019s simply not enough time to dive into this important and complex subject. Civics, at the very least, should be a full-year course, and students should be offered opportunities to take additional, more advanced civics courses as well.\nSecond, civics standards need a total overhaul. It\u2019s not enough to teach kids how bills become laws, they need to know more about their rights as Americans and understand the history behind the constitutional protections they have been provided. The United States is an exceptional place, but most students are being taught the opposite is true. Yes, some truly terrible things have happened in America \u2014 just as they have in all countries \u2014 but the United States\u2019 commitment to personal freedom has made America the most powerful, wealthy, successful nation the world has ever seen. Students need to understand these ideas. Civics isn\u2019t about laws, it\u2019s about rights and personal freedom.\nThird, state standards are too narrowly focused on knowledge attainment. States typically don\u2019t offer students any form of experiential learning as part of their civics standards. No wonder youth participation in politics is abysmally low. If schools want to improve civics scores, they should teach children why civics is important, and the best way to do that is by getting them directly involved with the lawmaking process through internships, volunteer opportunities, and field trips to local and state government buildings, including state capitols.\nAnother way to increase student engagement is to emphasize student government in schools. If students are able to get actively involved in the governance of their own schools", "gold_completion": ", it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll have a greater interest in the governance of their communities in the future.\nFourth, and perhaps most important, students and parents should be given access to universal education savings accounts, which allow kids to go to any school their parents like. This would permit parents who care about civics to have the option of enrolling their children in schools that teach the values they are most concerned with.\nAlthough these solutions will not solve the civics crisis overnight, they would be a step in the right direction. But in order for any of this to occur, teachers and parents need the freedom and flexibility to accomplish these goals \u2014 flexibility they have been denied by bureaucrats and some disinterested politicians who have proven repeatedly they don\u2019t care about improving civics.\nAchieving progress requires a completely different approach.\nChris Talgo is a former public high school teacher and an editor at The Heartland Institute. He wrote this for InsideSources.com.", "no_wm_completion": " and communities, they will have an appreciation of policymaking, but they won\u2019t necessarily view it merely as a fun hobby. They will start to understand that what happens inside a government building is more influential than what happens on TV, or in movies, or in the news. They will become more aware of how their votes can affect decisions that matter to their community. This is exactly what happened during the 2017 student government elections, when a school ballot initiative successfully passed to prohibit sexual assault in school, and more recently with the passage of the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d repeal.\nFinally, the best way to guarantee that schools offer a full-year civics course is to increase funding for civic education programs. We teach students government and economics and business, but not civics. This is why civics education is so important. If you don\u2019t teach it in high school, you are making education in government and politics a waste of", "gen_completion": ", they might actually benefit and be excited about civics classes in school.\nFinally, teachers need to be more critical and strategic in how they teach civics courses. When I taught U.S. history last year, I was surprised by how poorly some students were able to learn the material. The students were given textbooks that were so poorly written that it was a challenge to make sense of facts and the historical context surrounding a topic. It was disheartening to watch my students struggle with what they were reading, especially because I know how much effort many of them put into school work when they were in college.\nTeachers aren\u2019t to blame for this deficiency of civics instruction, because state standards are rarely updated to keep pace with society. We teach students a lot, and we provide all students with meaningful work experiences. The problem is the federal government doesn\u2019t do as much for teachers.\nPerhaps the most important change needed to help address this civics crisis would"}
{"prefix": "Apple: dead in the water, or on top of its game?\nSince I was reading this on my iPad Pro, which is probably the most useful electronic device I have ever owned, it came as a bit of a shock. But in fact Volker was really just articulating a truth about digital hardware, which is that the evolution of all such products (and a good deal else besides) follows a sigmoid curve.\nIt sounds complicated, but it isn\u2019t really. Think of it as a version of the letter S that\u2019s been flattened to form a graph whose vertical axis measures functionality while the horizontal axis represents time. What it tells you is that initially (at the lower part of the S) a new technology develops relatively slowly. Then there\u2019s a point where the functionality increases dramatically over a relatively short period, after which the rate of improvement declines steadily and levels off. The iPad is now somewhere on that upper plateau, which means that it\u2019s reached the point where one can only expect incremental improvements (faster processor, better screen, stereo audio etc). This is what Volker was getting at when he said that the device is \u201cdone\u201d.\nTo the hyperactive tech media sector this means that the product is no longer of any interest and that Apple has \u201crun out of ideas\u201d. In some cases it is also taken as confirmation that the company has never recovered from the death of Steve Jobs. Excitable Wall Street analysts may also see it as evidence that Apple stock should now be downgraded to \u201csell\u201d. All of which merely confirms the extent to which some of those who opine about technology don\u2019t understand it.\nSo let\u2019s put the iPad in its wider context. The device, as one expert, Horace Dediu, comments, has an installed base of 300 million users \u2013 which is far larger than the 100-150m Mac computers out there. And whereas the iPad built up this user base in roughly seven years, the Mac needed 33.\nDigging deeper, Dediu finds that iPad sales continue to increase in the US and the UK, and that user satisfaction with the product continues to be very high. A survey conducted in November 2015 found a 94% consumer satisfaction rate for the iPad Mini, a 97% rate for the iPad Air, and 96% for the iPad Pro; and that browsing, shopping and app usage data also show continuing high utilisation on iPads. Among corporate purchasers there is a 96% satisfaction rate, with 66% intending to purchase more iPads.\nMuch the same applies to the iPhone, another Apple device that attracts the same kind of commentary \u2013 about Apple running out of ideas, that there are only incremental improvements between the iPhone 6 and the forthcoming iPhone 8, and so on. The truth is that that device is also on that upper plateau of the sigmoid curve. It too is \u201cdone\u201d.\nThe", "gold_completion": " same applies to the smartphone generally. So the question is: what next? According to Ben Evans, a tech analyst who seems to know what the industry is thinking, the main candidates are: artificial intelligence (AI); voice interfaces (like Amazon\u2019s Echo, Apple\u2019s Siri and Google\u2019s Home); virtual reality (VR); and augmented reality (AR).\nSo we\u2019re left with AR \u2013 a technology that will enable you to point your phone at something and see some digitally exhumed information about it overlaid on the image.

And, just a few months later, a device called the Inspiron Ultra 13 became the fastest of all PCs and hit the market with a 90% market share. And so on.\nAnd now we\u2019re seeing a similar pattern of activity across a wide range of the company\u2019s products. For example, while Mac sales declined a little at the end of 2014, they have since shown \u201csteady growth\u201d as the iPhone was shipped more than twice as many units as previous models and Windows 8 was being installed to more and more PCs.

{"prefix": "The where and when are still to be determined, but there\u2019s no doubt that Parsons, the Kingston native who played at Archbishop Williams High School, will soon set the record for goals scored by a minor pro player. The 39-year-old winger netted No. 674 on Thanksgiving Night, leaving him just four from passing Kevin Kerr\u2019s 677.\nThe funny thing is, there was every reason to doubt Parsons would ever be in such a position. He only scored 18 goals in 107 career NCAA games at UMass-Lowell, after all \u2013 but there was a reason.\nIt took famously hard-nosed former NHLer Nick Fotiu to put Parson\u2019s soft hands to use. As a rookie head coach for the East Coast Hockey League\u2019s Nashville Knights, Fotiu agreed to his first-year pro\u2019s request to play forward in 1992-93, and Parsons scored 27 goals \u2013 amazingly, his career low for a season \u2013 as a third-line winger.\nParsons was soon on a tour of the ECHL, playing in Tallahassee, Fla.; Johnstown, Pa.; Lafayette and Baton Rouge, La., through 1998-99. The first of his six 50-goal seasons came in his only year in Johnstown (1995-96), and while it wasn\u2019t his favorite stop, none was more important: He met his wife, Kristen, when he was a Chief.\n\u201cDefinitely the silver lining to that year,\u201d said Parsons, today the father of daughters Abby (8), Maggy (6) and Maddox (5).\nThe next season was big, too: In \u201996-97, Parsons first played under well-traveled ex-NHLer Doug Shedden (Pittsburgh, Detroit, Quebec, Toronto) for the first time with the ECHL\u2019s Louisiana IceGators. Shedden next brought Parsons with him to Flint, Mich., where they won the 1999-200 United Hockey League championship, and then to Memphis of the Central Hockey League, where they won back-to-back titles (2001-02 and \u201902-03). Parsons scored at least 54 goals in his first three seasons with Memphis, and was twice named CHL Most Valuable Player.\nThe closest the ride came to ending was after 2006-2007, when Parsons\u2019 Quad City Mallards moved to the American Hockey League, leading the UHL to morph into a \u201cnew,\u201d scaled-down version of the IHL. (The \u201coriginal\u201d IHL, like the AHL a step below the NHL, folded after 2000-2001.) Bloomington claimed Parsons in a dispersal draft, and Parsons decided he could handle the two-hour drive from the Quad City region (on the Mississippi River, encompassing communities in Illinois and Iowa) to the U.S. Cellular Arena in Bloomington, home of the Prairie Thunder.\nDespite the long drive, Parsons is never far from reminders of the record he\u2019s pursuing.\nA player", "gold_completion": "-assistant to head coach Jarrod Skalde, Parsons is more concerned with the three-game losing streak Bloomington took into Friday night\u2019s game at Muskegon, Mich.

Kostopoulos has been a mentor for the Parsons family and his brother since they were teenagers, and has helped to get Parsons a $100,000 grant to help him try and win the league record.\nTo achieve the goal, Parsons is hoping he can use a new trick: He\u2019s decided to take advantage of the fact that the league has more scoring assists than goals, and since the puck passes from player to player more than from player to player, he should be able to pick up some more assists.

{"prefix": "Less than a century since DDT was first sprayed, the spread of the Zika virus through mosquitoes has left some wondering whether regulators were too quick to move away from the chemical. But public health officials warn returning the controversial pesticide to use could do more harm than good in some places.\nDDT, which first came into use as an insecticide in the 1930s, played a crucial role helping Allied forces protect themselves from mosquitoes carrying malaria in World World II and eventually helped eliminate the deadly disease from the U.S. But despite its successes, public opinion turned quickly in the 1960s as outrage grew over DDT\u2019s potential risks to human health and animals and many countries joined the U.S. in ultimately banning its use.\nToday, health officials caution that while the benefits of the pesticide can outweigh health concerns in some contexts, spraying DDT to combat Zika would be premature and potentially very misguided.\nThe first concern for public health officials when considering whether to use DDT is if the method of applying the pesticide will actually kill the targeted mosquitoes. Most applications of the pesticide today occur on the walls of indoor dwellings\u2014targeting mosquitoes that prey on humans while they sleep at night. This tactic, frequently used in Africa, works in areas where mosquitoes carrying disease bite at night while people are asleep, according to Lynn Goldman, dean of the George Washington University School of Public Health. More research is needed to understand other mosquito populations and learn whether DDT use will be effective.\nPolicymakers also have to weigh the potential effects of DDT on human health. The impact of the chemical is not necessarily immediate, but can be devastating to those who ingest it. Research has suggested that DDT has the potential to disrupt the human nervous system in the same way it does to insects. That may mean cancer, infertility and other long-term health effects including developmental problems in young children. DDT remains in the environment where it\u2019s sprayed for years, potentially affecting multiple generations.\nTaking", "gold_completion": " the risk of exposing people to DDT can make sense in areas at high risk for malaria\u2014though the question remains a topic of debate for health officials. After all, that disease kills nearly 500,000 people each year. But it less makes sense, at least for now, when combatting a disease like Zika that doesn\u2019t kill those it infects and has yet to spread as widely. Unnecessary use of DDT will also make it less effective going forward as mosquitoes grow resistant. The first round of spraying DDT will effectively kill a large share of the local mosquito population, but fewer and fewer of the insects will die with each consecutive spray, limiting its utility in a future crisis.\nInstead of focusing on pesticides to address Zika, public health officials are now advocating a comprehensive approach to addressing the virus that includes studying the species of mosquito that spreads the virus, developing a Zika vaccine, eliminating places where mosquitoes can breed and potentially introducing genetically modified mosquitoes that will help reduce the population.", "no_wm_completion": " into account the potential human health impacts in these contexts, health officials must weigh whether it would be wise to expand the use of DDT. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers DDT to be a chemical of environmental concern, a designation it maintains even after it\u2019s discontinued in one county. While Brazil was the first country to permanently ban DDT in 1967, the country remains vulnerable to mosquitoes carrying Zika because it has few mosquito control methods and no effective mosquito traps, which the EPA suggests might need to be installed to control the spread of the disease.\nThe question of whether it would be wiser to apply DDT still looms large in Brazil, where the Zika virus has spread so fast. Public health officials in Rio de Janeiro, where the disease has spread most dramatically into the country, are waiting to hear whether it would be a good idea to spray DDT to control mosquitoes, a step they are considering after learning that the insecticide could also kill some", "gen_completion": " into account the potential risks and benefits in these contexts, health officials must judge whether in the long-term using the pesticide to eliminate mosquitos is justified.

{"prefix": "Project will pay growers to try methods to keep harmful carbon in the soil.\nOn 1,100 acres of farmland near Austin, Minn., 47-year-old Tom Cotter has embraced no-till planting and cover crops that keep carbon stored in his soil and out of the atmosphere. Cotter changed his farming methods for financial reasons, not just to fight climate change, and stuck with them long enough to see them pay off.\nCotter sees a new pilot program in the 2018 federal farm bill that pays farmers to experiment with the same growing style as a chance for others to enjoy the economic and environmental benefits he has.\nThe $25 million test project will measure how much additional carbon the agriculture sector can keep out of the atmosphere by leaving fields untilled or minimally tilled and covered with vegetation.\nFarming techniques that fight climate change by increasing carbon stored in soil do not work everywhere, explained Tim Smith, a professor of bioproducts and biosystems engineering at the University of Minnesota. But where they do work, soil quality and productivity improves. They also reduce the need for fertilizers that contribute to carbon in the atmosphere.\nThe pilot program aims to \u201creward farmers for sequestering carbon in their soil, but we need to verify that they are doing that,\u201d said David Kolsrud, who farmed in Luverne before starting a private funding group and working in the renewable-energy sector.\nThe carbon sequestration experiment in the farm bill was the brainchild of an unlikely coalition that includes the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) as well as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the American Coalition for Ethanol. Those normally competing groups came together to persuade Congress to fund a model for encouraging farming that is simultaneously profitable and environmentally friendly.\nThe project will pay selected participants to revive old farming methods to draw more carbon from the atmosphere into the soil and keep it there.\n\u201cAg [has] a major opportunity to protect the climate,\u201d said Nicole Lederer of E-2, a group that advocates for policies that work economically as well as environmentally. Lederer helped broker the deal between the corn growers and the resource council that led to the pilot program.\nFundamentally, the program relies on disturbing the soil as little as possible to limit the release of carbon stored in the roots of plants and decomposing vegetation. It also emphasizes keeping ground covered with crops year-round to prevent the release of carbon from erosion by water or wind.\nCotter said the combination reduces the need for fertilizer. \u201cInstead of spending 20 bucks an acre killing the ground, I want my soil livestock [worms and other organic creatures] doing my tillage,\u201d he said.\nThat can mean planting cover crops rather than letting fields lie fallow. It especially means cutting down on or eliminating tillage, said Lara Bryant, NRDC\u2019s deputy director of water and agriculture nature programs.\nNo-till or low-till farming requires some special equipment. Cotter grows no-till soybeans using an $1,800 adjustment to the closing mechanism on his planter. He grows low-till corn by planting seed in narrow bands about 10 inches wide. He bought a used vertical till machine for $8,000 at auction to help do that and shared the cost of the machine with a neighbor.\nThese sorts of techniques fell out of favor in the 1970s when plentiful land and expanding crop production led farmers to use \u201cmore extractive systems,\u201d according to Bryant. Rewarding those who invest in equipment to return to the old practice is a necessary part of the pilot project.\nThe prospect of cap-and-trade payments for carbon reduction or the development of low-carbon fuel standards and products such as low-carbon feedstock", "gold_completion": " can provide financial incentives, Lederer said.\nThe Minnesota Farmers Union offered its imprimatur to the pilot program as advocates made their case to members of Congress. Farmers union President Gary Wertish said details of how the program will work are still being developed. The basic concept includes paying farmers who undertake healthy soil practices, measuring their success and passing the data on to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to set up payment rates for various practices that could be funded under the agency\u2019s environmental quality incentives program, which averages about $2 billion a year in the new five-year farm bill.\nCalifornia already has a state program that rewards farmers for sequestering carbon in their soil, Kolsrud noted.\nHow well the program would work in Minnesota depends on where you farm. In Blue Earth County, Minnesota Farm Bureau President Kevin Paap said the short growing season and frozen ground can be obstacles to no-till and cover-crop strategies.", "no_wm_completion": " for biofuels are motivating those who are already making the change, said Kolsrud.\nThe bill \u201cputs the policy on the table, and it says \u2018This is what we need to do for the next 10 years,'\u201d Kolsrud said.\nSmith said he envisions the pilot program in a similar vein as when the EPA created its landmark carbon-cutting rules for power plants. The EPA wants farmers to use existing energy technology to help control carbon but help them avoid major subsidies during that process.\nSmith said the environmental benefits of reducing carbon in the atmosphere will far outweigh the potential financial costs. He pointed to research that concluded no-till can restore nitrogen into the soil within about four years, cutting erosion and boosting soil health. He also points out that crop carbon is being stored in the soil as long as the soil remains moist and productive.\n\u201cThe soil stays alive. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re breaking", "gen_completion": " for soybean oil, however, is stirring up a debate of another kind that could get louder.\nSome farmers have complained that low-till practices don\u2019t make for profitable crops as they reduce the nutrients in the soil and may increase erosion.

The project has the support of the state farm agency. However, the environmental benefits of putting more plants into the ground far outweigh any potential costs, said Mike Gaffney, a representative of the state agriculture department.\nBy comparison, planting wheat on no-tilled land could prevent a reduction in carbon as much as planting soybeans would, said Brad Holmquist, an Iowa State University extension agent on the project.\nBy not planting wheat, farmers are taking \u201can enormous amount of"}

The country's legal system had long relied on an older, more formal system for cases that involve political violence.\nIn order to end the use of juries for cases in which the accused are public figures, Japan must win approval from the U.N. General Assembly. Many Japanese have questioned the change from the top down.\nPrecht's Japanese clients want their cases to be handled by a single judge, and he wants Japan's top lawyers to be allowed to defend the case in person in court.\nCritics say Japanese citizens aren't ready for this kind of change.

Training for these activities prepares participants to develop a systematic plan to fill their sales pipelines. Typically, training courses define prospecting, describe why it is important to a business, show how lead-generation systems work, and describe how to evaluate sales leads. You can develop your own workshops, typically as part of a larger sales-training curriculum, or purchase materials from training providers or consultants. Choose the format and scope based on your needs and budget.\nSales-prospecting training prepares participants to establish a sound approach to making calls. For example, a salesperson should develop a script for leaving voice-mail messages. These messages should clearly communicate the features and benefits of a product or service and give a compelling reason for people to contact the seller for more information. Training also provides tips and techniques for getting referrals and networking with other business professionals to sell collaboratively. Sales-prospecting training also provides participants with resources, such as videos and podcasts that provide advice from industry leaders. These resources typically cover topics such as finding new customers, promoting your business during the holidays, using email and video and selling overseas.\nTo generate new leads, salespeople need to communicate effectively.

The CO2 explains what's happening and nothing else does.\"\nMichael Mann, an atmospheric science and geoscience professor, also of Penn State, agreed.\n\"While climate does change naturally, we are warming the planet at an unprecedented rate, putting carbon into the atmosphere a million times faster than the natural geological increases in carbon dioxide that were responsible for e.g. the warmth of the early Cretaceous period,\" he wrote in an email.\nCiting information gathered by the National Research Council, NASA estimates the earth has warmed by approximately 0.7 percent over the last century, which it says represents a rate of warming roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of ice-age recovery.\nClimate change is already harming both human and natural systems.\nWrightstone, who has a master's degree in geology, told the committee that while he has published papers on paleo-climatology, he hasn't written any on contemporary climate science.\nHe has self-published a book on his theories.\nWrightstone spent most of his career in the natural gas industry.\nAfter his testimony, he confirmed he worked as a geologist for the Pittsburgh-based gas company Texas Keystone for 20-odd years, but said the experience doesn't influence his current work.\n\"If I was still receiving payment or being influenced by them, yes,\" he said, his gas industry work might be a", "gold_completion": " factor. \"But that has no influence on me.

{"prefix": "Why the country's media missed its 'Harvey Weinstein moment'.\nLast October, the Harvey Weinstein scandal shook the US media industry into a moment of reckoning. Outlets that had previously shied away from, and in some cases covered up, abuses by the Hollywood producer began harassment investigations that saw a host of household media names pushed from their pedestals.\nItaly, home to two of Harvey Weinstein's accusers, also felt the shockwaves. But Italians hoping for a similar impact on their fourth estate, where victim-blaming and objectification are notoriously common - were to be disappointed.\nInstead, two features marked the fallout: the near absence of names named, and the ferocious reaction faced not by the accused, but the accusers.\nItaly, it would seem, had missed its \"Weinstein moment\".\nThe problem is, it's difficult to expose such cases, especially when they happen in the industry that is supposed to be doing the exposing! And that's an industry whose leaders tend to be, on the whole, men.\nSix months on from the scandal, The Listening Post went to Rome and Milan to ask journalists and media experts why the scandal played out so differently in Italy, and to discuss the problematic representation of women in Italy's media more generally.\nOne of Weinstein's Italian accusers is the actress Asia Argento, whose testimony of sexual assault met a media response that - with some exceptions - ranged from scepticism to open abuse.\n\"First they go along with it, then they whine and pretend to repent\", goaded a headline in the conservative newspaper, Libero. Libero's editor, Vittorio Feltri, was one of several prominent journalists to label Argento's story as one of \"prostitution\" - comments that his deputy, Pietro Senaldi, happily defended in his interview with us.\n\"You have to know the man,\" Senaldi insisted. \"It is well known that his journalistic career and his reputation are based on how direct and how blunt he his \u2026\"\nFor Elisa Giomi, a sociologist specialising in gender and media at Rome Three University, it was a feature she told us, that is typical of media coverage of such cases in Italy: \"a tendency to split the victims of sexual harassment into two categories: the innocent ones and the women who asked for it.\"\nWe asked all our contributors why so few cases of harassment, including in the media industry itself, had been uncovered by Italian journalists. Pietro Senaldi's explanation was simple: \"What I think is that in Italy, this phenomenon has not exploded because it is less dramatic than it is in the States. Definitely less dramatic.\"\nIt's a notion each of our female interviewees strongly disputed, pointing out that such cases are not hard to find - if you are looking for them.\n\"Just because there have been no denunciations to date doesn't mean it isn't happening in the media as well,\" said Claudia Torrisi, a contributor to VICE Italy.\n\"The problem is, it's difficult to expose such cases, especially when they happen in the industry that is supposed to be doing the exposing! And that's an industry whose leaders tend to be, on the whole, men.\"\nThe predominance of men in the upper echelons of Italian media is something many believe bears a significant responsibility for another persistent feature of Italian media: the objectification of women on Italian television.\nSince the advent of Silvio Berlusconi's MediaSet network in the", "gold_completion": " 1980s, scantily-clad showgirls - known as \"veline\" - have become an almost standard fixture across the TV landscape.\nFor Gianmaria Tammaro, a journalist and TV critic for a number of publications including La Stampa newspaper, it's a concept that belongs in another era. \"It was a particular idea of what the average Italian viewer wants - a viewer that paradoxically is always assumed to be male.\"\nPietro Senaldi apart, on the whole, the people we spoke with viewed the Weinstein scandal as a missed opportunity for Italy's media to re-examine how it treats and portrays women.\nHowever, they also felt the industry was moving, slowly, in the right direction.

Then visit us in person.\nRaised in September 1862, the 155th NYVI served with distinction until July 1865. Almost all of the men of the 155th were Irish; many of them had only come to America since the time of the Famine of 1846-47.\nThe 155th was raised as part of Michael Corcoran's \"Irish Legion,\" a brigade containing the 155th, 164th (zouave), 170th, 175th, and 182nd New York Volunteers.

The regiment fought under both the flag of the United States, and a green, regimental color with Irish and New York state symbols.\nThe 155th's first fight was in January 1863 in Virginia, and over the next two and a half years, the regiment actively campaigned in the East. It served in a number of major battles, including the Siege of Suffolk, Virginia; Spotsylvania, North Anna, and Cold Harbor, where the regiment saw its heaviest losses. The 155th took part in the Siege of Petersburg, and fighting around that area, and it was part of the forces that chased the Army of Northern Virginia to its destiny, being present at the that force's surrender at Appomattox Court House.\nThe unit mustered into United States service with 820 men; by July 1865, only 130 men were present at Lee's surrender at Appomattox, Virginia.\nDuring the war, many 155th members also belonged to the Fenian Brotherhood. After the war, these veterans joined the 7th New York Regiment of the Irish Army of Liberation, which in June 1866, joined the Fenian invasion of Canada, fighting the Battle of Ridgeway, Ontario, and several smaller actions around Fort Erie. Though victorious on the field, the heavily outnumbered, and unsupported attempt to take control of Canada (to hold for the exchange for Irish independence from Great Britain), failed.

She was a sixty-three-year-old chicken farmer, living in the Ozarks with her husband and their daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, a well-known journalist and popular author. Wilder\u2019s own literary ambitions were, she told Lane, for \u201cprestige\u201d rather than for money, and they may have dated to her youth, though they had been thwarted by a married life of hardship and calamity.\nWilder would certainly capture the big market. She lived to the age of ninety, and published eight novels for young people\u2014the perennially beloved \u201cLittle House\u201d books\u2014that have sold some sixty million copies in more than thirty languages. In the nineteen-seventies, the third installment of this family saga, \u201cLittle House on the Prairie,\u201d was adapted as a drama for television that ran for nine seasons. The Wilder farmhouse, in Rocky Ridge, Missouri, has become a shrine that receives some forty thousand pilgrims a year, and six other sites mentioned in the series are landmarks or museums devoted to its lore. But the memoir that Wilder drafted during the first year of the Depression, in her tidy longhand, filling a series of school notebooks, was never published until now.\n\u201cPioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography\u201d is a handsomely illustrated, large-format volume that represents years of work by a team of scholars. Their project was sponsored by the South Dakota Historical Society, and published by its state-subsidized press last November.

{"prefix": "Look out! There's an app barreling toward your skull, and it's going as fast as a car.\nAmong the most powerful things about the first iPhone was how it made old software metaphors \u2014 pressing buttons, scrolling through pages \u2014 much more literal. Scrolling was now linked, one-to-one, to the tip of your finger. You didn't click a button on a mouse to command a software cursor to press a button for you, you just tapped it with your thumb. This was a profound change and one that was hard to advertise or talk about. But it was something that users were able to grasp almost immediately.\nMovement in iOS, and in Android, is generally directly connected to one of two actions: a tapping or swiping, or hitting a button or dragging (or pushing!) something around. The weirdest these direct actions really get is pinch-to-zoom, which is somehow intuitive but doesn't really have a real-world equivalent. These are all vital in making iOS feel like iOS.\nAlso vital: the animations, which, in iOS 7, are centered around zooming. Or, more accurately, flying. Tapping an icon sends it flying at your face, at which point it begins to transform into an app. Closing it pulls it back away from you; it's as if the app is falling into the screen. Our minds take every other movement metaphor in iOS literally, but this one is weird. It feels three-dimensional in a way that others don't.\nThe sensation of depth is exaggerated in iOS 7, and profound enough that it led some users to complain of a sort of seasickness (which Apple both acknowledged and provided a fix for, in an update).\nI used the small-angle approximation since the size of the object (in this case the app) is significantly smaller than the distance from which you are observing it. This allowed us to assume that the apparent size of the object is inversely proportional to the distance from which you are observing it.\nIn order for an iPhone app to appear to be the width of an iPhone icon, it would have to be about 5.33 feet away. That is to say, if iOS animations suggest that the icons are falling away from you, they are falling about 5 feet, and moving pretty fast. Assuming it takes about 0.8 seconds for this animation to complete, the app is moving at an average of about 6.6 feet per second, or about 4.5 miles per hour: a slow jogging speed.\nThose 19.29 feet are traveled, again, in about 0.8 seconds, which works out to a little more than 24.1 feet per second, or 16.4 miles per hour. That's an average too \u2014 the animation accelerates then decelerates. Or", "gold_completion": " at least it looks that way. It seems probably that, at its top speed, this icon is flying at or away from your face at over 20 miles per hour.\nKind of casts that motion-sickness stuff in a new light! iOS 7 certainly hints more strongly at depth than iOS 6, in which the zooming felt less physical. It was more like expansion than zooming, a closer relative to pinch-to-resize.\nUpdate: Developer Steve Streza provides some background, on Twitter: \"Those animations are based on spring physics. So it's like you stretched a spring from you to the folder and then let go... Animations pre-iOS 7 were based on sine wave curves. iOS 7 animations have a more gradual decay.\" Thanks Steve!\nAnyway, now you know why iOS 7 doesn't just look different, it feels different: Every time you close an app to a folder, you're hurling it about 25 feet away from your face.", "no_wm_completion": " rather, the application accelerates and decelerates.\nSo that's what an iPhone app, or more specifically the app of the thing you tap, looks like. There doesn't seem to be a lot of mystery to how it gets in your face, or why it would seem so fast and strange. But the key takeaway:\nThe iPhone app is flying away, not falling away.\nIf you think that feels wrong, you may have trouble understanding where the iPhone is coming from. But if you think it looks odd or weird, you may have trouble knowing where it's going.\nBecause of this, I made a video in which I walked down a random street and took a photo of every app that we saw. Then, as I explained in the video below, I walked up to an iPhone that was sitting on a concrete curb, and took one look through the app drawer and noticed that the app actually looks like it's falling away from me.\nSo that's what an", "gen_completion": " rather, the apps are moving so quickly that we don't notice that they're running away from us.\nThis is one of the strangest things in iOS 8 and why we are not yet certain what it is or how it came to be. There are some clues, however, provided by the icons that appear when we press the rightmost touch sensor \u2014 a small square if there is no app icon and a circle in its place if there is one.\nThe iPhone is able to sense that there are not app icons on the display by simply looking for the grayed-out area in a white background, which is what Apple calls the app icon. When you are holding and dragging the thumb gesture along the screen, you are holding up an app icon. The app icon takes over. When you press the two points on the right edge of the screen, one icon appears and another fades in \u2014 your app.\nThis may not sound like much \u2014 a tiny square for an icon \u2014 but"}
{"prefix": "You might be shocked to learn exactly how much those bad habits are costing you in potential retirement savings.\nWe get it. You enjoy your morning latte, and we don't want to take that away from you. But we could all cut back on some guilty pleasures without sucking the fun out of life.\nDon't think you can do it? Take a look at just how much more money you'll have in retirement if you make these small changes to your spending habits.\nDining out in restaurants is fun, but doing it too often is expensive and unnecessary. Get into the habit of eating at home for just one weekend a month, that's all we're asking for. You can still go out for dinner every other Friday and Saturday night. The average American spends $252 a month eating out, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you skip two restaurant meals, we figure you'll save $63. By the time you hit retirement age, you'll have a couple hundred thousand extra in the bank.\nA quicker ride home is always tempting. But barring a torrential downpour, maybe the convenience isn't always worth the cost. Though a $20 cab ride might not seem like a big splurge, doing it once a week is costing you $960 a year. That alone could be enough to buy you an entire house in retirement.\nCan't stand to give up the convenience for good? If a cab-free life feels like too much of a sacrifice to you, try doing it for just one year. You'll still end up with an extra $19,365 in retirement.\nSmoking a pack a day costs Americans an average of $176 a month, according to WalletHub. Plus, it's bad for you, so quitting is a win-win. If you have trouble kicking the habit, just think of the cumulative savings of well over half a million dollars. When we did the math we assumed you'll go cold turkey -- and never go back.\nDon't worry, you can still splurge on a latte here and there. But consider this: A $10 bag of ground coffee should last you at least a month and still give you the same caffeine fix. So skip buying your daily $2.50 Cup of Joe and brew it at home. As a reward, splurge on a tall Starbucks latte once a week. You'll still come out ahead $24 a month.\nIt's important to stay fit, but there are plenty of ways to do it that won't put your financial health at", "gold_completion": " risk. If you're only going once or twice a month, it might be time to quit the gym -- especially if it's a pricy sports club.\nWe don't expect you to say goodbye to treadmills forever, but maybe a membership doesn't fit your schedule right now. If you cancel a $40 monthly membership, it would save you $480 over the next year. That alone could give you an extra $9,682 of spending cash in retirement.\nAmericans spend an average of $46 a month on alcohol, according to the BLS. You might spend a lot more or a lot less. No one is saying you have to kick the habit altogether. But wine drinkers could probably save at least that much by choosing a BYOB restaurant twice a month, or drinking at home instead of going out. Restaurants are notorious for marking up the price of wine, charging upwards of $25 for a bottle that could cost you $12 or less at a liquor store.", "no_wm_completion": " risk.\nIf we can stop putting ourselves in danger by walking away from the coffee machine, we can do the same for our finances: Cut back on fast food, red meat and soda. Skip the daily bagel or McDonald's breakfast bar. The soda alone is costing you $1,200 a year, according to a recent report from Health.com. Plus, your waistline will thank you for the fizzy diet refreshment.\nSpending an hour on the elliptical machine and burning more than $100 is easy to justify. Plus, if you do it once a week it's a great way to start exercising at lunch -- or even grab it for the weekend.\nIf you prefer to work out at a higher intensity, try switching up your workout routine by adding yoga instead of cardio.

But if the dishwasher isn't in the budget right now, make sure it stays that way. If your home has a dishwasher, you could be paying thousands a year in rental fees. Skip that, too, and start chipping away at debt instead. Skipping the $600-per-year rent bill for a few years (letting it accumulate, that is) will total more than $6,000.

{"prefix": "By Monday night, 23-year-old Tori Kelly might be in possession of her very first Grammy. But only a year ago, she was a relative unknown whose audiences were rooted mainly in YouTube subscriptions.\nKelly, who auditioned for American Idol's ninth season as a teenager in 2010, was cut from the show just before the its live semi-finals after some particularly harsh criticism from judge Simon Cowell. While the rejection hit Kelly hard, she told Ryan Seacrest last year it incited her to buckle down on her craft and prove her worth as a musician.\n\"I was bummed when I got cut, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then it was kind of awesome because, I think, by getting cut from the show, something stirred up in me to want to write.\"\nAnd that's precisely what she did. In 2012, after releasing six-track EP Handmade Songs By Tori Kelly that Kelly, herself, produced in her bedroom, the singer caught Scooter Braun's eye, and found herself under Capitol Records' management within the year. A second EP, Foreword, continued to cultivate a fan base, and demonstrated her appeal as a complete, wild-maned package.\nIt was 2015, though, that signaled Kelly's rise into official breakthrough artist territory. At the 2015 Billboard Music Awards, and armed with only an acoustic guitar, she tore through \"Nobody Love,\" her debut album's first single, and delivered what was generally considered to be the show's most striking performance. Unbreakable Smile's release a month later was proof of the broadcast's power \u2014 the LP debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and \"Nobody Love,\" which peaked inside Billboard's Top 20, was certified gold. By pairing an enduring singer-songwriter sound with more explosive tracks like \"Expensive,\" Kelly honored her most devoted fans while opening herself up to a more mainstream audience.\n\"Should've Been Us,\" released next, also went gold.\nAs pop began to embrace Kelly's relaxed attitude and penchant for producing radio-worthy hits, she reminded everyone with a tribute to Smokey Robinson at the 2015 BET Awards that she was, at her core, a soul artist.

It wasn't hard to navigate, but it wasn't easy either.\nNow, the baseline rules of conduct on Facebook are grouped into four categories -- such as \"Keeping you safe\" -- that aim to make it easier to find a policy on a particular subject and offer a little more about Facebook's policies.\nThe new design also includes descriptions of existing policy that Facebook hasn't put in its community standards before, but do explain how the company currently operates, Bickert said.\nFor example, there's a section now in the community standards that explains how the company deals with \"Dangerous Organizations,\" which makes it clear that Facebook doesn't allow \"terrorist activity\" or \"organized criminal activity\" to have a place on its site. The company had broadly covered that prohibition in its previous standards, but decided it was worth explaining a little more deeply in the new format. Facebook has also broken out a section detailing \"Attacks on Public Figures.\"\nBickert said that the company wanted to keep the language as simple as possible since the community standards are universal across the company's approximately 1.3 billion users -- covering Facebookers of all ages, on all platforms and in all of the countries where the network reaches.

Section 3303 established statewide rules for oil and gas activities irrespective of existing or future local zoning rules. Section 3304 required municipalities to allow oil and gas development activities in all zoning areas.\nThe court\u2019s ruling is significant in that it nullified these three provisions of Act 13, but even more so because of the court\u2019s reason for doing so.

{"prefix": "Looking at your Facebook page may help you accept criticism and weather attacks on your ego, a study suggests.\nThat time you're spending on Facebook may not be wasted productivity, after all.\nAt least, that's what yet another Facebook-based study has found.\nYou may remember Stuart Smiley, the fey self-affirmation addict portrayed on \"Saturday Night Live\" by now-Sen. Al Franken. He stares into the mirror and declares, \"I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and, dog gone it, people like me.\"\nThat's what Facebook does, according to a study published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.\nWe already know that looking at other people's fun times on Facebook could make you envious. And we've seen that you are what you like on Facebook \u2014 a computer algorithm based on \"likes\" can home in on such things as sexual orientation, political leanings and psychological traits including openness and conscientiousness.\nSo, think of your Facebook page as Stuart Smiley's mirror: It contains a lot of your core beliefs and preferences, and it puts your network of friends and family at your reach. In psychologist language, it can \"satisfy fundamental ego needs regarding desired self-images.\"\nYou can't directly measure any Facebook bump in self-esteem or any bump generated other ways. But you can measure defensive behavior to criticism. It's been shown that the self-affirmation experiences similar to those spoofed by Stuart Smiley reduce defensive responses that are naturally elicited by ego threats.\nPsychologists have tested this repeatedly. Usually they ask a participant to list strongly held beliefs and write an essay about the top one. After that, the participant invariably reacts better to a blow against the ego. The essay acts as self-affirmation.\nThe participant who chooses to write about a lower-ranked value but about how others may think it's important generally is more defensive. The essay had no self-affirming effect.\nTurns out, looking at your own Facebook page is the social network equivalent of that first essay. Looking at another person's page is the non-affirming experience.\nCatalina Toma, at the University of Wisconsin, and Jeffrey Hancock, at Cornell, study communication and social networks. They devised two experiments. In the first, some students got to look at their own Facebook page, while others looked at a stranger's page (it turned out to be another study participant's page). Some wrote the self-affirming essay, while others wrote the more neutral one.\nNow the ruse: Participants were told they were there to evaluate a distance-learning public speaking course. Each was to write a short speech on the legality of abortion and deliver it to a camera, then get feedback and rate the feedback by various aspects. The trick: Participants wound up with the same negative feedback.\nWhat happened? Results were as expected: less defensive response from people exposed to self-affirmation activity; more from those who did not get that experience. And it turned out that the proportion between those two responses was the same for those who wrote the essays as for those who viewed Facebook pages.\n\u201cFacebook has just as big an effect on self-esteem as traditional tools,\u201d Hancock said.\nBut would someone who gets a negative feedback actively seek solace in Facebook? The second experiment tested that. They used a similar cover story: testing a public speaking program. But this time feedback was randomly negative or neutral. After the feedback, participants were allowed to choose an activity: looking at their own Facebook page, watching YouTube videos, listening to online music, reading online news or playing online video games.\nAfter receiving neutral feedback, participants were equally likely to choose any of", "gold_completion": " those activities.

Researchers took that into account.\nFacebook's rank among the activity choices (tested before the experiment) for those who got negative feedback was lower than the average rating of the other activities.\nWhy would any of this be important? Well, it gives experimenters a new tool to use instead of the essay, and there are about a billion people who use Facebook in any given month. That's a gigantic laboratory.\nBut Facebook might one day be part of therapies that use self-affirmation, such as programs to quit smoking or to change other habits.\n\u201cAnything you need to be stronger at, self-affirmation is good for you,\u201d Hancock said.\nMaybe you'll find that you're good enough, smart enough and, dog gone it, people press the like icon on your posts.", "no_wm_completion": " the four activities for the rest of the session. They didn't seem less likely to engage in particular self-affirming experiences, like reading Facebook posts. They just seemed more likely to engage with other activities.\nAnd just as they predicted, those exposed to Facebook self-affirmation responded more strongly to a negative feedback than a neutral one.\nHow did the experiments affect self-esteem? Toma and Hancock suggest that having friends who are critical can contribute to a feeling of inadequacy. \"These findings indicate that the sense of self-worth people may feel from other people's social status is just as much the product of the social networks that individuals create as any other aspects of the interaction,\" Toma said in an email. \"Thus, these relationships should be considered not as a means for fulfilling one's self, but as an important way to build one's self-worth.\"\nThe takeaway? Don't be so hard on yourself and others. Just be aware that looking at other's", "gen_completion": " the activities, regardless of who told them they were there.

The authors of a study in 2013 showed that the \"like\" button had the same effects as the \"share\" button. That study wasn't a real-world study, it was an experiment, but it showed the same effect.\n\"It makes sense,\" said J.

{"prefix": "Some Apple Macs have a particularly terrible flaw that lets hackers sneak in and remain undetected, a security researcher has found.\nIt means a hacker could -- from far away -- force a Mac into a coma. Personal, corporate or government Macs could be spied on in a way that even the best security checks wouldn't discover -- until it's way too late.\n\"This is scary,\" said Sarah Edwards, a forensic analyst at the SANS Institute who specializes in reviewing computers for evidence of hacks. \"I would never see this. There could be funky stuff going on in the computer system, and I would never know why.\"\nWhat makes this one so bad?

It's the kind of thing you should never tamper with. And it should obviously remain heavily guarded.\nBut Macs purchased one year ago or before, apparently, leave a door open.\nWhen a Mac goes into sleep mode and wakes back up, it allows direct access to the BIOS.

An attacker first needs administrative access to a machine. But what this means is that if a Mac gets hacked with a low-level computer virus, it can bury so deep you'll never find it.\nThat's the real problem here.

{"prefix": "Recently, I was gifted with a little bottle of blessed oil brought from an orthodox monastery in Greece. The aroma of this blessed oil is powerful, profound and, yes, mystical.\nObviously, when I say mystical, I am not talking about esotericism. The joint document, entitled \"Jesus Christ the Bearer of the Water of life: A Christian reflection on the 'New Age'\" issued by the Pontifical Council for Culture and the Pontifical Council for interreligious Dialogue, describes it as \"a search for knowledge, and magic, or the occult\". On the contrary, what is mystical is revealed because it is not the theoretical knowledge for the chosen few but holiness as the everyday bread and butter for every person. As Jesus himself tells us: \"Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven \"(Matt 5:19). Therefore, Christian mysticism is about being great and not being small. It is about being authentic and not fake by placing oneself above others.\nThe bible teaching which tells us that you and me, thanks to Jesus' Spirit in us that we received both at our baptism and at our confirmation, lives in us, is found in Paul's Second Letter to the Corinthians. Here Paul says: \"But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?\" (2 Cor 2:14-16).\nBoth Jesus Christ and Satan have their aroma. The aroma of Jesus Christ is \"love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control\" (Gal 5:22-23). Moreover, the Bible tells us that Christ's aroma is also compassion, \"kindness, lowliness, meekness,... patience,... forgive[ness],... perfect harmony,... love,... thankful[ness], teach[ing], admonish[ing] one another,... do[ing] everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, [and] giving thanks to God the Father through him\" (Col 3:12-17).\nAlmost every person I anoint and pray over with this blessed oil tells me: \"Father! What a nice smell this oil has!\" You are hundred per cent right my dear brother and sister! Because, if you and I carry within our hearts love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, patience, forgiveness, perfect harmony, thankfulness, teaching, admonishing one another gently, doing everything in the name of the Lord Jesus and giving thanks to God the Father through Him we certainly smell beautiful. The reason is that it is no longer our weak smell of sin that we carry in our hearts but Christ's fragrance. And, when you and I let God's Spirit live in us and cultivate within us these holy and beloved attitudes then Jesus can look at us and say to us personally: \"How sweet is your love, my sister, my bride! How much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice\" (Cant 4:10).\nYes! The fragrance of our oils, the oil of the Holy Spirit, is much more", "gold_completion": " powerful than the spice of this world of sin and death. That is why Satan's aroma is so horrible!

The Bible describes Satan's aroma as being \"fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, party spirit, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like\" (Gal 5:19-21). Because Satan's aroma is eternally destructive, the Bible lovingly warns us to keep away from it: \"those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God\" (Gal 5:21).\nWhen you meet me, especially at Mater Dei as I visit patients, their families, hospital staff and going round the hospital following the example of the Merciful Shepherd, remind me to anoint you with this aromatic oil, place my consecrated hands on you and pray that you too be transformed by Christ's aroma.", "no_wm_completion": " potent than any kind of perfume.

And Jesus can see not only the beautiful and sacred things but the beautiful, holy and beloved things too when He touches us through these oils! And when we walk through His eyes, no matter how dark and ugly they might be, they can only be beautiful and holy and beloved!\nAnd then there is Mary's fragrance. Mary did not keep the fragrance of her pregnancy with Jesus a secret from the people (Luke 1:49).

Think of yourself as a pump at a gas station. Everyone comes to you for a fill-up, but at some point, the tanks holding all the gas for those pumps run low. If the tanks aren\u2019t refilled, there\u2019s no gas available to help all those vehicles keep running.\nCaregivers are like those gas pumps. If you don\u2019t refill your hidden tanks \u2013 reservoirs of energy, health, peace and commitment \u2013 you won\u2019t be able to share that strength with the person for whom you are caring. This can lead to resentment, anger and depression, and can have a negative impact on your own health.\nAccording to the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP, approximately 29 percent of the adult U.S. adult population served as caregivers for an ill or disabled relative. Caring for people who are at the end of life can become especially intense \u2013 emotionally, physically and spiritually.\n2. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat can I change? And what do I have no control over?\u201d You might not have any control over the outcome of your loved one\u2019s illness, or the personalities and issues that other people have. Accept that there are some things that are out of your control. But you can change yourself, and how you react to situations.\nReach out to others. Ask your church, family, friends or neighbors to come in and help, or even sit with the patient, whether for a couple of hours or overnight.\nGet plenty of rest, \u201ceven if a friend, family member or church member needs to sit with your loved one so you can sleep for a few hours,\u201d Melody says.\nTake care of your spiritual needs. Attend your church, synagogue or mosque when you can; meditate; ask someone to pray with you; and/or seek support from a spiritual advisor.\nGet physical \u2013 walk, exercise, do yoga \u2013 whatever helps to strengthen your body and ease your mind.\nTalk to other people and let them know what you\u2019re going through. Cry if you feel like it.\n4. Take advantage of respite care.

Our health care providers are experts in hospice care and are willing to help if they can be of assistance. Many health care providers also offer extended care to help parents, grandparents and other caregivers for people they are caring for.\nIf you care for a loved one at the end of life, you will likely feel the stress of keeping things together and caring for yourself at the same time. When caring for someone alone, don\u2019t feel bad about taking a break. You\u2019re only human; no one can do it all for you.\nAnd if you\u2019re doing it for yourself, don\u2019t try to force yourself to do it. \u201cYou are not a failure for taking a break,\u201d Cindy says. \u201cYou\u2019re helping your loved one.

{"prefix": "Like other public organizations, fire and emergency medical services are going through a number of major changes to keep up with the needs and demands of local municipalities. New models are emerging to meet the changing times.\nOne of these models is community paramedicine, which in essence allows EMS personnel to visit the homes of individuals who require medical assistance. These individuals are not medical emergencies that require transportation to a hospital emergency room.\nFor years, 911 calls from individuals who needed medical attention but are not emergencies have overburdened EMS units. These calls created a number of patient care problems and strained hospital ER services.\nCommunity paramedicine is designed to address these issues. Numerous articles and studies cite the overall benefits of this model, showing how in the long run, non-emergency patients need fewer trips to the ER.\nHowever, ER services are again under stress due to the current nationwide opioid crisis. Emergency medical services must respond to countless overdose calls that burden EMS workers and take away necessary resources from other emergencies.\nA recent study shows that many overdose patients do not get the care that they need to break the cycle, even after one or more emergency trips to a medical facility. However, an interesting new measure has emerged that meets the need to help drug overdose patients.\nAccording to Dan Swayze, community paramedicine can be used to monitor opioid-addicted patients detoxing at home. Swayze says a couple of cities are starting to use this model, which could be a boon to the community and potentially reduce the number of opioid-related drug overdoses.\nEmergency medical services will continue to change as the needs of local municipalities change. Community paramedicine is definitely changing the way EMS agencies are reacting to opioid overdoses. If community paramedicine is widely used to monitor addicts at home, it may prove to be a tremendous asset in breaking the opioid epidemic cycle.\nAllison G. S.

The equine population resides from the west to the east, with nearly every breed of equine represented. The heaviest horse population is west of Fairmont Boulevard where spacious horse properties house the tradition of the old-time West.\nAn act of protecting our semi-rural neighborhoods that brings the charm to our city is hovering over the General Plan, and the cowboys and cowgirls are the vigilant sentries of the equestrian heritage.\nAs Yorba Linda began to develop on the east side, a major developer offered to include an equestrian center, which did not materialize. This developer however contributed $200,000 for a future center. Over the years, the gift funds grew to nearly $500,000, and before the assets were reallocated, the equestrians rode their horses to City Hall, with some of the miniature horses making their whinnies heard at the Council Chamber\u2019s podium.\nTheir peaceful demonstration gave notice to the City Council, which selected an equestrian committee made up of representatives from various equestrian groups to look into the operations and needs of developing a world-class equestrian center, and to select areas where the equestrian center could be located.\nSue Leto, director of Parks and Recreation, led the appointed Equestrian Committee in several meetings as the group elected to designate the equestrian park as a first-class facility that would compliment the Community Center and the Tommy Lasorda Jr. Field House. The equestrian committee envisioned a resource that would be desirable for weddings, banquets and community gatherings, as well as a boarding, training and learning facility, a Class A show facility and a therapeutic riding center.\nSeveral sites were walked by the committee. After several meetings, the committee elected the upper south side of the dry lakebed of the Yorba Linda Reservoir, preserving the lakebed as a natural habitat of wildlife and hiking and riding trails.\nOn Oct. 21, 2008, the council voted to send out a request for proposals for a feasibility study on an equestrian park at the dry lakebed. This vote drew one neigh from Jan Horton, who desired more study time.

Many equestrians board their horses in Chino, Norco, San Juan Capistrano and even Temecula.

According to a Reuters report, production of the company's solar tiles have been delayed by assembly line problems.\nPart of the issue is producing tiles that meet the aesthetic standards of company CEO, Elon Musk.\nUPDATE: Aug. 13, 2018, 9:03 a.m. CEST A Tesla spokesperson told Mashable that there are no problems with the product's looks. \"The claim of a former employee that Solar Roof is delayed due to aesthetics is false. We are ramping the production and installation of Solar Roof substantially,\" the spokesperson told us via email.\nAnnounced in October 2016, Tesla's Solar Roof tiles are advertised as a beautiful, durable alternative to regular roof tiles that also happen to produce electricity to power your home. But the production at Tesla's Buffalo, New York plant that opened last year has been so slow that it forced Panasonic \u2014 Tesla's partner in this venture \u2014 to sell components it built for Tesla to other buyers. This is according to unnamed current and former Panasonic employees as well as a former Tesla employee.\nAnother former Tesla employee told Reuters that the aesthetic look of the tiles, which is not always up to par with Musk's standards, is the \"big issue\" here. According to Reuters' sources, only one out of four versions of the Solar Roof tile \u2014 the black-textured one \u2014 has been produced so far.\nThe black-textured Solar Roof tile (pictured) is the only one Tesla has produced so far, the report claims.\nIn a response to Reuters, Tesla said it's working to improve production output but declined to give any exact figures. \"We are steadily ramping up Solar Roof production in Buffalo and are also continuing to iterate on the product design and production process. We plan to ramp production more toward the end of 2018", "gold_completion": ",\" the company said in a statement.\nLast week, Musk said there are \"several hundred homes\" with a Solar Roof installed, and that the project was \"going well.\" But Tesla now clarified to Reuters that this number includes homes that are scheduled to have the roof installed as well.\nPanasonic told Reuters it has been selling \"some\" of the solar panels produced in the Buffalo factory under its own brand, instead of selling them to Tesla.\nThe delayed production could become a problem for Tesla, as the company was given $750 million in state subsidies in order to build and equip the Buffalo factory. Under the terms of the agreement, Tesla must employ 1,460 people in Buffalo within two years of the factory's completion. It also needs to spend $5 billion in New York state over ten years. Right now, the state's regulators believe Tesla is meeting its obligations, and Tesla said the facility currently employs about 600 people and is \"on track\" to meet its commitments.", "no_wm_completion": ",\" the company said.\nOne of Tesla's challenges when it debuted this concept is that its tiles aren't the traditional flat tiles. The company had designed its Solar Roof tile to be a \"shiny, smooth sheet that glows in the dark.\" But Tesla had difficulty making the solar tiles that look right, according to the report. \"It took Tesla about 13 changes and modifications, including some iterations, before the company reached the point it considered the product to be satisfactory,\" Reuters claimed.\nIf Tesla has reached a point that only one out of four of the tiles are being produced, that means that there are about 8 million Solar Roof tiles out there, and Tesla is only producing about 1.6 million of them a year.\nIt's unclear how many of the tiles are still in production or, as Reuters stated, whether Tesla was even able to send parts from its Buffalo factory to Panasonic's factory in Tokyo or Europe.\nThis isn't the first time that Tesla's solar roofs", "gen_completion": ",\" the company said.\nOne other source told Reuters that if the Solar Roof line really is going to struggle, it's unlikely that Tesla will invest in new facilities to make it properly.\nThis is likely how that problem started in the first place. The company had difficulty attracting skilled solar panel installers because it didn't have sufficient infrastructure or equipment to educate them on exactly how this technology worked. Tesla also wasn't using its best manufacturing processes.\nTesla had to shell out millions of dollars to the Solar Technologies Business Unit, Tesla's parent company. The unit is one of Tesla's largest spending units, as it funds research that has led to an improvement in the production process of Tesla's self-driving cars. Tesla is also hoping to develop a way to create batteries that wouldn't require as much carbon, as Bloomberg reports.\nSome of the Solar Roof tiling process is automated, using lasers, lasers that burn heat into each tile, and a laser to make sure tiles are aligned before"}

Ryan Silvey would expand Medicaid coverage for veterans and their families making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $29,685 for a family of three.\n\"The other proposals that I have will cover not only veterans but everyone, but I felt it was important to try and solve this problem for this group,\" Silvey, R-Kansas City, said.\nMissouri is one of 23 states that has not used a provision of President Barack Obama&apos;s health law to expand Medicaid, a joint federal and state program that provides health care to low-income individuals. Missouri&apos;s Republican legislative leaders have said there&apos;s little chance for any expansion this year.\nAs part of the federal Affordable Care Act, states that expand Medicaid coverage for families and individuals making up to 138 percent of federal poverty can receive more federal funding.\nCurrently, able-bodied adults without children do not qualify for Medicaid in Missouri. Parents making less than about 19 percent of federal poverty, or $3,612 for an adult with two children, do qualify.\nMany working Missourians fall into what Silvey and others call a coverage gap, making too little to qualify for subsidies to pay for insurance through a government exchange, but too much to qualify for Medicaid. This includes working age adults under 65 making less than $11,670 for a single person.\nSilvey said early estimates were at least 22,000 spouses of veterans would qualify for Medicaid under the proposal.\nDewey Riehn, Veterans of Foreign Wars legislative chairman, said expansion would benefit many veterans and their families.

Medicaid expansion is already legal for the 133 percent of the federal poverty level that is $16,660 for an individual a year, but the coverage is not a requirement.\nIn May 2011, a Missouri appeals court struck down the state&apos;s Medicaid expansion", "gen_completion": "iehn acknowledged state officials have a tough time figuring out a cost estimate.\n\"It&apos;s one of our biggest issues,\" Riehn added.\nSilvey said he would have liked to cover caregivers as well, but he acknowledged that was not possible under the current law.\n\"It&apos;s a tough one,\" Silvey said.\nThe proposal comes as Missouri House Republicans are debating Medicaid expansion. Four Missouri Democrats previously voted in favor of expanding Medicaid, but all are now against the idea. House Speaker Tim Greitens, a Republican from Missouri, said Tuesday he agrees with GOP leaders in voting against any expansion.\nReps.

{"prefix": "Back in the mid-1990s, I had the opportunity to meet Dr. Irving Wladawsky-Berger, then vice president at IBM, who was charged with building a new generation of supercomputers. But Dr. Wladawsky-Berger didn't go out and spend a huge budget on specialized hardware. Rather, the genius of his approach was to take sets of already-manufactured processors -- at the time, RISC processors from IBM's Unix family -- and lashed them together with a high-speed switch to create supercomputing power. A few years later, the follow-on generation of supercomputers was built in a similar fashion from x86 processors running Linux.\nWelcome to innovation, 21st Century style. A couple of months ago, I posted some observations about innovation coming from low-cost and conveniently available parts -- part of the formula for success for our era: \u201cGood enough\u201d may be good enough when it comes to developing new products and services.\nOne powerful byproduct that has emerged from this paradigm is supercomputers. The latest and fastest behemoth, as a matter of fact, was built from PC chips from Advanced Micro Devices. The supercomputer, as described by The New York Times' Ashlee Vance, runs at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee \"and can throw hundreds of thousands of processing engines at computing problems.\"\n\"The supercomputing world was long dominated by systems that required specialized chips, memory systems and networking technology. But about 10 years ago,", "gold_completion": " researchers realized they could link thousands of cheaper machines running on mainstream chips and achieve pretty solid performance.\"\nThe idea that many small commodity processors could work together to provide supercomputing power is being seen in other forms, such as grids. For example, the SETI@home project employs individual users across the globe, who donate unused cycles to help sift through data in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.\nThe Top500 list of the world's current top 500 supercomputers was just released, and just about all are built with commonly available commodity processors. In fact, 79% of the world's fastest supercomputers run on clusters of Intel EM64T processors.\nAcross all product categories, the high-end brands, typically offered as part of well-crafted and expensive interdependent architectures, will be displaced by more modular approaches offered by commoditizers. In the process, new markets will open as more companies or people have access to more affordable approaches.

The systems can run on inexpensive memory and allow scientists to concentrate on complex problems, whereas prior supercomputing systems, such as those based on PCs or central processing units, required specialized and expensive technology.\"\nThe supercomputing world, then, has transitioned to a higher state of being, with the addition of even cheaper, commodity-based supercomputing hardware. The supercomputer may have moved a few orders of magnitude along the innovation curve, but it is still a work in progress.\nHere is what I mean -- this is a time where innovation is no longer just a nice-to-have, in a perfect world scenario.\nThis is a time", "gen_completion": " computer scientists and engineers built chips and software that could run on ordinary PCs.

The computer is simply a piece of digital hardware designed to perform one specific task, then moved through the marketplace and consumed. The supercomputing world was different.

{"prefix": "Warminster, Pa. - THE horticultural world is having its own debate over immigration, with some environmentalists warning about the dangers of so-called exotic plants from other countries and continents \"invading\" American gardens. These botanical xenophobes say that a pristine natural state exists in our yards and that to disturb it is both sinful and calamitous. In their view, exotic plants will swallow your garden, your neighbors' gardens and your neighbors' neighbors' gardens until the ecosystem collapses under their rampant suffocating growth.\nIf anything suffocates us, though, it will be the environmentalists' narrowmindedness. Like all utopian visions, their dream beckons us into a perfect and rational natural world where nothing ever changes -- a world that never existed and never will.\nNative plants are the survivalists of the botanical world, and in the appropriate settings -- wilderness areas, home and botanical gardens, public parks and sidewalks -- they bless us with their beauty and awe us with their tenacity. Our lives would be poor and grim without the strawberry, cranberry, columbine and trillium. They've always been here, in the same way that Native Americans have been; only their arrival and settlement are more ancient.\nLike human survivalists, natives are also subject to exploitation by the horticultural equivalent of radical fundamentalists. The anti-exotics argue that gardens should be populated exclusively by native plants, as if the exotics were trying to enter the flower bed illegally. The consequences of such a stand could be dire. Should we eat no onions or garlic, apples or lemons; feast our eyes on no magnificent tulips or roses -- all exotics of Eurasian origin? Should Asians not enjoy their distinctive peppers, tomatoes, beans, squash, sunflowers and corn -- all from the Americas?\nIndeed, the world's most popular root crop, potatoes, started life as a staple of the Andean people and achieved its first international fame as a slave food. By the time it reached France, the \"earth apple\" was a delicacy likened to truffles; their flowers were featured in tiaras of court ladies. Exotic indeed.\nShould we deprive ourselves of petunias, begonias, impatiens and hollyhocks -- not a one of them \"native\"? Must we, on pain of being cast out of the garden as horticultural pariahs, deny the elephant his peanuts? This wouldn't be merely ridiculous. It would compare with the denial of human immigration on grounds that certain ethnic groups breed in numbers \"too prolific\" for the existing elite to tolerate. Imagine, then, a horticultural ruling class. No \"invasives\" need apply: let the lily find another valley. Such prohibitions of exotic plant species demonstrate only an elitist snobbery that is as dangerous to a free society as it is to a free botany.\nNo one, and certainly no gardener, grows truly destructive invasive plants in his garden.

Aside from requiring a bit of weeding, exotics are safe as milk, unless one considers gardening a chore rather than a passionate hobby. If so, forget the forget-me-nots.\nLet's welcome, as spring arrives tomorrow, as many huddled masses of flowers, herbs and vegetables as can fit in our unique melting pot of a nation, unrivaled in its tradition of lush diversity and freedom to grow rampantly.\nOp-Ed Contributor George Ball, a former president of the American Horticultural Society, is the president of the seed and plant company W.

The real culprits are modern farmers who choose to grow crops that yield large areas in a single season -- a strategy that is a recipe for kudzu and drought.\nThe anti-exotics argue that if we ignore exotic plants and replace them with noisome indigenous species, our gardens would \"look\" better but they wouldn't be less natural.

That disaster was precipitated by severe drought conditions in 1979 and 1980. Today, Southern drought conditions vary annually and could run in cycles lasting decades -- a phenomenon tied to a complex interplay of environmental variables and the growing pressure of so-called \"smart growth\" policies designed to spur urbanization; but if you are in an area not experiencing prolonged drought conditions, this plant is no surprise. The problem is not a lack of access to water, but rather that Southern farmers are not growing the soil in the way that their forebears had planned, and the kudzu plant has taken root.\nIt will become difficult, however, to keep this"}
{"prefix": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi is probably the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back, but that doesn't mean it's without its faults. From the over the top barrage of humor to some certain things that made fans laugh or cry at the wrong time, we've collected some of the biggest gripes with Rian Johnson's first foray into the Star Wars universe. While they're not horrible offenses, they've for some reason or another left a bad taste in the mouths of fans, much like the weird green milk Luke Skywalker ingested on Ahch-To from that weird alien sea cow. Brace yourselves, there are SPOILERS AHEAD, so if you haven't seen The Last Jedi, you might want to stop reading.\nOne of the worst things about The Last Jedi are the Canto Bight scenes. They seem out of place, almost like George Lucas directed them and had the scenes patched into the movie without telling anybody. From a weird drunken space leprechaun feeding BB-8 gold coins to some of the lamest inhabitants of any alien planet in the Star Wars universe. It is definitely the bathroom break portion of the movie with the only saving grace being the introduction of Benicio del Toro's DJ character into the fold. Elsewhere, the Fathiers have weird almost human-like faces to prove how sad they are while some poor orphan kids clean up after them. Never mind BB-8 shooting gold coins out of himself like a bizarre machine gun. The whole scene that leads to Canto Bight turning into the nightmare of the movie is undoubtedly the parking violation. Rose and Finn get arrested for a Parking ticket? This can't be real and it truly looks like George Lucas wrote that into the script because it reeks of his style. Those fans griping that Lucas isn't represented in The Last Jedi, look no further than 2 main characters getting arrested for a parking violation at a casino. It's just plain lazy and not even humorous, except to maybe George Lucas.\nCaptain Phasma was promised to be a bigger character in The Last Jedi and she clearly was not. She's barely in the movie and when she is on the screen for a substantial amount of time, she apparently dies and we get to see her eye. There's no big reveal and she doesn't even seem as tough as she does in The Force Awakens, which basically means that she's another throwaway character who does all of the press and promotion for the movie, but is barely on the screen.\nAnother gripe about The Last Jedi is the lack of background on Supreme Leader Snoke. J.J. Abrams built the leader of the First Order to be this huge deal and Andy Serkis was telling anybody that would listen that the villainous alien is more powerful than Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine. While Snoke looks amazing and Serkis' portrayal of the character is commanding, the dude gets cut in half by Kylo Ren, really easily too. So here's this big bad villain that everybody has been wondering about for 2 years and now nothing. Just cut in half with no mention of anything else.\nOk, so this might be a bit controversial, but Leia using the Force to get", "gold_completion": " back to the ship after floating in space was a bit over the top. Sure, Carrie Fisher did a spectacular job, but the whole Mary Poppins (sans umbrella), gliding through space was a bit comical from a purely visual standpoint. Otherwise, it's really cool to finally see her tapping into her Force abilities, but it could've been executed a little better. George Lucas has reportedly told Rian Johnson that he can redo the scene in 20 years and re-release it into theaters along with some other touchups.\nSpeaking of controversy, some fans believe that the absence of Jar Jar Binks actually made The Last Jedi worse. No kidding, fans have taken to social media and bemoaned the fact that Jar Jar didn't return and save the movie from what, we just don't know. This is a real complaint about the movie and it isn't immediately understood, so we'll just let that simmer for a while and come back to it a little later.", "no_wm_completion": " Luke's attention after the Battle of Endor? This is probably the funniest, or perhaps even the most absurd scene in the entire movie.

For the most part, The Last Jedi has a good sense of humor in it and the comedy was there and fun to watch and I loved it, but it also had a lot of problems. This is because I am getting a little frustrated with Star Wars and with J.J. Abrams. He should know better.\nThere is also this odd decision to call it \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" when it's still just Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I get that Johnson is not a Skywalker, but when you show a guy named \"Luke\" that you've been using for 40 movies in front of millions of people, you don't have to use his name", "gen_completion": " Luke's lightsaber after his and Rey's deaths? This is something that was made very clear during the first trailer for The Last Jedi. Unfortunately for Star Wars fans that grew up watching Star Wars growing up and saw a lot of this stuff in the first 3 films, this is just not the case in The Last Jedi. For the majority of the movie, it has a sort-of back story for the characters like Poe talking about how Leia had a vision in the temple. This was a major spoiler from the very first trailer because it meant that the movie would not be as dark and dramatic when it comes to all of the Force stuff.\nSadly, that's what we get, it is just a bit of exposition about what the movie is going to be and what it means to Star Wars as a whole. The scene also doesn't make sense in the beginning; it doesn't make sense that a force user, who holds the entire galaxy with absolutely nothing to help them and no one to help"}

It just wasn\u2019t scalable. \u201cPeople really don\u2019t buy that way, even when they say they will,\u201d he says. \u201cThey like to buy their meat in trusted places where it\u2019s stored cold \u2013 grocery stores and butcher shops.\u201d The other problem was that farms don\u2019t do business that way either \u2013 they don\u2019t deliver their meat throughout the city because they simply don\u2019t have time. Getting into the consumer market would mean turning into a supply chain company, Jones realized, and he didn\u2019t want that.\nInstead, he looked to who were the biggest buyers of meats, and decided to enable them. Here in the U.S., that\u2019s the distributor businesses which sells to the retailers. There are a number of these businesses which are independent (meaning not under contract from larger distributors like Monsanto or Cargill), but still fairly good-sized companies.

And in the end, AgLocal could still offer consumers a mobile solution that lets them know where in their city they can find the locally raised, sustainable meats.\n\u201cSustainable,\u201d although not the original inspiration for the business, is a key part of AgLocal\u2019s potential.

But farmers don\u2019t have time to sell, says Jones, they\u2019re operators.\nBesides the impact to farmers\u2019 margins, mechanized farming contributes to a whole host of problems: pollution, what they do to the meat we consume because of overcrowding issues and the antibiotics pumped into the animals, and, ultimately, what they do to our healthcare costs because of the meat we consume.

However, the show definitely has some elements of a sequel, too, as viewers will see in the premiere's first frew minutes.\nSo, yes, you'll get to see what became of Saul Goodman after he left Walt and Jesse Pinkman.\nWhen we spoke with Odenkirk a while back while he was doing press for his Oscar-nominated film \"Nebraska,\" the star told us he wanted the show to be both a prequel and sequel. It looks like he got his wish.\nWho will star in the spinoff?\nJonathan Banks will reprise his role as Mike Ehrmantraut.\nMichael McKean will play Saul's older brother Chuck who is a partner at a law firm in Albuquerque.\nPatrick Fabian plays Howard Hamlin while Rhea Seehorn (\"Whitney\") stars as Kim, two lawyers at Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill.\nMichael Mando (\"Orphan Black\") plays a criminal named Nacho Varga.\nSo, what will this be about?\nThe show will follow Saul Goodman before he's the cocky, confident lawyer, when he's just known as Jimmy McGill.\nMcGill's strapped for cash and drives a rundown car. He's trying to make a living as an honest attorney. What should follow in the series is how McGill goes from a scrappy, hungry young lawyer to a well-known name in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nWhy did Saul get his own spinoff?\nThe show has been in the works for a while in the \"Breaking Bad\" writers room. Creator Vince Gilligan told Hitfix it kind of started off as a joke.\nIt started as a lark, which is another word for joke, in the writer's room. It started and it really came from the fact that I love working with Bob, just as we love working with really every actor on \"Breaking Bad.\" But we also loved the character. We love writing for the character. We love putting words in his mouth. And we had so much fun indeed doing that that it started as a lark; we'd come up with some great term or phrase and we'd laugh about it in the writer's room. And then we'd say, 'You know, when we're doing the Saul Goodman show we'll be able to blah, blah, blah, blah.' And we made that comment so many times that it started to dawn on us that it wasn't a lark; there was truth to it. It was not just a joke, but a potentially good idea.\nIf I like \"Breaking Bad,\" will I enjoy it?\nI think you will. From what I've seen in the first two episodes (I'm waiting out to watch the third at the moment), there are plenty of nods to the original series while not feeling forced.\nYou'll see a few familiar faces including Jonathan Banks, and the visuals and montages will feel straight out of \"Breaking Bad.\"\nHowever, don't go into this show wanting another \"Breaking", "gold_completion": " Bad.\" You'll be disappointed.

{"prefix": "A system that aims to identify stolen passwords before breaches are reported or even detected was launched on Tuesday.\nShape Security's Blackfish credential defence system is designed to detect the use of stolen usernames and passwords by criminals and in real time.\nThe technology is a mechanism for organisations to identify the abuse of stolen passwords and attempts to hijack accounts long before these same purloined credentials show up for sale on the dark web.\nCybercrooks regularly automate the process of testing stolen or leaked passwords on third-party websites.\nFor example, customers of online takeaway firm Deliveroo found their accounts hijacked and charged for food they never ordered because of a credential-stuffing attack. In another attack using the same method, passwords and email addresses from previous breaches were abused to gain access to 26,000 online UK National Lottery accounts. Groupon blamed fraudulent purchases from some UK customers' accounts on password leaks from other sites.\nCredential stuffing only works because many users still use the same login details on multiple sites. This is a serious security risk that's only getting worse as the volume of data breaches rises.\nShape Security's network data shows that in many industries, such as retail, more than 90 per cent of all login attempts to websites often come from credential-stuffing attacks instead of genuine users.\nShape Security's customer base includes three of the top-four banks, four of the top-five airlines, two of the top-five hotel chains, and two of the top-five US government agencies. Crowdsourcing alerts about brute-force credential-stuffing attacks among its customers makes for an effective early warning system, the firm claims.\nCTO and former Google clickfraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder told El Reg: \"Cybercriminal organizations are businesses, and they need an ROI, so it just doesn't make sense for them to go after smaller websites with credential-stuffing campaigns. Over the last five years, Shape has created and deployed technology to protect the login systems of the major banks, airlines, retailers, and other industries where cybercriminals first use stolen credentials to take over accounts.\n\"So in this case there isn't much of a 'long tail' associated with the attack data, since cybercriminal activity is concentrated in the high end of the market.\"\nFacebook, Twitter and other companies have been researching the dark web for several years, acquiring lists of stolen credentials to protect their users. \"This can be helpful but its utility is limited,\" said Gh", "gold_completion": "osemajumder. \"Darknet-sourced lists of stolen credentials tend to have much less value compared to credentials which have been recently stolen, which sophisticated cybercriminals first use against leading consumer sites, such as those that Shape protects.\"\nShape's credential defence technology ultimately aims to end credential-stuffing attacks by making stolen data worthless to cybercriminals. But initial reaction from security experts has been mixed.\nPer Thorsheim\u200f, founder of PasswordsCon, commented: \"They want to collect passwords used in the wild against sites and services, then provide them to customers who can find and invalidate (change) accounts using those passwords. Interesting idea, but skeptical to both security and user experience. This is an online service.

They're actually doing the things we're trying to prevent,\" said Ghosemajumder.\nThe new technology can spot an account hijacked after it has compromised a site.

You then have to build a predictive model that understands what kind of accounts are being accessed and whether there are any known credentials associated with those URLs. You then have to test in the real world\u2026and that's a lot of testing time.

It was so tempting to eat the raw dough while making them \u2014 talk about a lesson in delayed gratification \u2014 but in 20 or so minutes, delicious buttery, sugary cookies dotted with chocolate chips would be ready to enjoy.\nNever mind fancy desserts; chocolate chip cookies have always been one of my favorite treats. And if you are like me and find them irresistible, you probably can\u2019t stop after a few bites.\nThen there\u2019s the chocolate, which, in addition to sugar, contains small amounts of a compound known as anandamide. Interestingly, anandamide is also a brain chemical that targets the same cell receptors as THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the active ingredient in marijuana that is responsible for its mood-altering effects.

The combination of the toasted grain with the browned butter, caramelized sugar, vanilla and chocolate are \u201cthe beautiful rich flavors that blend together in a chocolate chip cookie,\u201d she said. And as the chocolate melts, it becomes more aromatic and punches up the flavor.\nThe texture of chocolate chip cookies also plays a big role in their appeal. \u201cJust on the texture side, [the chocolate chip cookie] has a lot going for it,\u201d Civille said.\n\u201cEvery bite will be interesting. \u2026 You will hit the cookie, which has crispness due to air pockets in the cookie crumb, and then the chocolate, which is dense and uniform when you bite through it. It\u2019s like a symphony orchestra playing together. \u2026 It\u2019s very harmonious,\u201d she said.\nOne of the simplest ways to test whether the flavor and texture of chocolate chip cookies are \u201caddictive enough\u201d is to observe people eating them.\n\u201cWhen I would create any product, if I put it out as a sample to my staff", "gold_completion": " and if I didn\u2019t watch them unconsciously go back and take some more, then I felt it wasn\u2019t good enough.

It also is one reason political analysts give for the tenacity of both British and Argentine claims to the Falklands.\nA second opinion, supported by recent work done for the US Department of Energy by the US Geological Survey, says that Argentina's oil-rich sedimentary beds both onshore and offshore may end well before reaching the midway point between Argentina and the Falklands.\nThe oil industry can only resolve the question of the Falklands' oil potential by drilling exploratory wells. Preliminary steps have been taken but the major work remains ahead.

Other experts see production possible in the area within five to seven years -- if the British and Argentinians resolve their political differences.\nThree years ago, before British-Argentine relations soured, the countries jointly licensed seismic surveys.

Dr. Albert W. Bally, former chief geologist for Shell Oil Company and now chairman of Rice University's geology department, however, sees a clear ''oil incentive'' behind Argentina's attempt to reclaim the Falklands.\nAccording to a petroleum expert at the World Bank, the possibility of oil riches is very attractive to Argentina.\n''With internal economic and political problems the government is naturally going to take action to divert public attention away from these problems,'' he says.", "no_wm_completion": " exploration wells in the Falkland Islands area.\nA new oil discovery in New Zealand's offshore Hauraki/Deep Sea Oil Field has helped push the worldwide total to over 5 trillion barrels of unburned petroleum.

These can pump more than ten million barrels of oil a day. Many of the seepage wells are near major oil producing countries. More than 50 such wells are in operation off the Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico.\nThe USGS estimates that the best areas for finding new seepage wells are in North America, Australia, and the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.

Their estimates are about 10,000 barrels per day of oil-equivalent, roughly 2% of the potential oil reserves in the area.\nThis estimate is still too low because seismic surveys and drilling work may take years.

{"prefix": "Council Post: Can Advertisers Balance Scale And Quality?\nCan Advertisers Balance Scale And Quality?\nFounder and CEO of Taykey, a real-time audience data company.\nIn the wake of several high-profile cases of large advertisers appearing next to terrorist videos, the issues of inventory quality and safety are once again top of mind for the advertising industry. We\u2019re seeing a renewed flight to manually vetted solutions such as private ad exchanges, predefined publisher whitelists and traditional direct media deals where marketers run exclusively on hand-selected publishers.\nUnfortunately, advertisers also pay the price in the form of reduced scale, efficiency, and the ability to reach and engage their consumers most effectively. While the appeal of these manual approaches is understandable, their trade-offs are often unnecessary based on the advertiser\u2019s objectives. Increasingly, whitelisting and private exchanges are being used as a crutch for bad data and inaccurate targeting rather than a proactive strategy.\nThe primary challenge is consumer behavior itself. More than 30% of web traffic is driven by social media. Millennials check their phones more than 150 times per day, jumping from social platforms to articles to videos. Most of this phone time is \u201clife in the feed,\u201d where discovery reigns supreme and social conversation is driving consumption. As a result, the new prime time looks less like \"M*A*S*H*\" and more like Joseph Garrett (aka Stampy), who makes humorous Minecraft videos in his basement in the U.K. and has amassed more than 8.4 million global followers.\nBut that isn\u2019t typically how content targeting is approached when humans take the wheel. It\u2019s driven by broad category-level approaches and the gut instinct of the buyer rather than real-time consumer insight. Still, every advertiser has a right not to run next to ISIS videos. But most things aren\u2019t ISIS. They\u2019re Bill O\u2019Reilly, Kendall Jenner and PewDiePie -- safe territory that has suddenly become toxic -- and manual targeting approaches will leave you chasing your tail here, too.\nLuckily, with the right tools, the massive and growing volume of conversation data across social platforms and websites can be mined via natural language processing (NLP) to tell advertisers exactly what content consumers do care about in the moment, repeatedly and at massive scale. Speaking of Kendall Jenner and Bill O'Reilly, the same NLP technology would have automatically flagged these topics as controversial (based on sentiment detection) and instructed automated buying systems to avoid them as soon as the controversies erupted. The right tech can actually turn the challenge of consumer fragmentation into an opportunity, by leveraging the growing volume of social conversation to map consumer interests and align targeting accordingly.\nIn fact, we recently developed a product offering that connects NLP directly to real-time media buying decisions. We've seen this capability become increasingly valuable as audience attention continues to become more dynamic and unpredictable. For example, a men's magazine recently did an exclusive interview with Brad Pitt that went viral with women 25-", "gold_completion": "49. Even though advertisers were not initially aligned with the content, the system used context and conversation patterns to understand the who, what, and why and shift media dollars in real time.\nAccurate real-time alignment with relevant topics can be an effective way to proactively address both quality and safety concerns without locking down scale and flexibility. After all, do we believe that soccer moms were consuming ISIS videos, or were those consumer-packaged-goods ads just poorly targeted in the first place? If soccer moms were talking about these videos, it\u2019s highly likely that the sentiment wouldn\u2019t be positive.\nThat said, automatic blacklisting of problematic keywords and categories (e.g., terrorism) is a sensible safety layer that's worthy of investment. But completely reverting back to manual buying techniques does more than hurt scale and efficiency. It runs counter to the realities of consumer content consumption and will eventually leave marketers unable to achieve prime-time level scale and engagement online.", "no_wm_completion": "to-49 years-old across all platforms.

In addition to capturing large volumes of sentiment data across the web and mobile, a robust NLP product can actually help advertisers understand how to craft their own content that is most likely to resonate with consumer intent.

{"prefix": "Pension ULIPs offered by insurance companies are tailored to the needs of investors to accumulate their retirement corpus. They are similar to regular ULIPs in terms of nature and cost structure. Both have a lock-in of five years and the premiums paid are tax exempt under Section 80C up to \u20b91,50,000 annually.\nPension ULIPs are long-term investment products working in two phases: 1) accumulation and 2) income.\nDuring the accumulation phase, you can build your retirement corpus by investing in different asset classes. They levy various charges towards premium allocation, policy administration and switching. As mandated by the insurance regulator, pension ULIPs should guarantee at least the total premium paid by the policyholder at the time of pay out. For this, an investment guarantee charge is levied by the insurers ranging from 0.10 to 0.50 per cent per annum. Some insurers levy mortality charge calculated on the sum at risk. On death, the nominee would receive the higher of the fund value or 105 per cent of the total premiums paid so far. The nominee would be given the option to either withdraw totally or purchase an annuity product from the same insurer.\nOn completion of the policy term, the policyholder will receive the maturity proceeds (vesting benefit) \u2014higher of the fund value or at least 101 per cent of the total premium paid. As per the current regulations, one can withdraw one-third of the maturity proceeds as lumpsum, which is tax-free. The balance must be converted into an \u201cannuity\u201d that is offered by the same insurer. The payments from annuity are taxable as per the policyholder\u2019s tax bracket.\nHDFC Life Click 2 Retire is an online pension ULIP. The premiums collected are invested in two funds \u2014 pension equity plus and pension income fund \u2014 in certain proportion, as prescribed by HDFC Life. Here, the limitation is that the policyholder has no right to choose the fund option. The proportion of allocation is based on the policy term chosen. For instance, for the 35-year term, the allocation to equity fund in the first year is 80 per cent and 77 per cent in the second year. In the 20th and 30th years, the allocation to equity fund will be 29 and 2 per cent respectively. The allocation towards income fund increases as you near the maturity date.\nHDFC Life Click 2 Retire is cheaper than other pension ULIPs available in the market. The premium allocation and policy administration charges are nil. The fund management charge is 1.35 per cent of the fund value. The average expense ratio of the direct and regular plans of the balanced mutual funds were at 1.2 and 2.3 per cent (as of February 2018). About 0.5 per cent per annum is levied (on fund value) as investment guarantee charge across the policy term. This is higher relative to some other pension ULIPs that levy the charge only on the sum at risk. That means they charge nothing if fund value exceeds the total premium paid.\nOn death, the higher of the fund value or the 105 per cent of the total premiums paid so far is given. The nominee can either withdraw this amount as lumpsum or purchase an annuity product from HDFC Life to get pension. On maturity, the policyholder is given higher of the fund value or assured vesting benefit.

Lynton Crosby\u2019s last text to me predicted that we were going to \u2018do well\u2019, which according to our expectations would mean a Conservative majority of more than 60. A late projection, based on data from the ground and Jim Messina\u2019s modelling, suggested we would win 371 seats, giving us a majority of 92. In the end, the Conservatives got their highest share of the vote since 1983, and more votes than Tony Blair managed in any of his elections, yet still we ended up with a hung parliament.\nSkilful leadership may deliver stability, but the absence of an overall majority means the nature of the Brexit deal the government negotiates is more uncertain. There has long been talk of a choice between \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 forms of Brexit, with the latter requiring membership of the EU\u2019s single market. Since that would involve accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, vast annual membership payments to the EU, and the continuation of free movement rules, people who voted to leave the European Union might wonder whether advocates of a \u2018soft\u2019 departure really do understand that Brexit means Brexit.\nBecause this election failed to produce the majority we needed, it is impossible to call the campaign anything but a failure. Before it began, we envisaged a return to traditional campaigning methods, with daily press conferences to scrutinise Labour and promote our policies. Theresa, never comfortable hogging the limelight, expected to make more use of her ministerial team. On the advice of the campaign consultants, and following opinion research that showed Theresa to be far more popular than the party or her colleagues, we eschewed our instincts. We were wrong to do so.\nMy biggest regret, however, is that we did not campaign in accordance with the insight that took Theresa to Downing Street in the first place. While the referendum result was undoubtedly an instruction for Britain to leave the EU, it was also a vote for change. One can disagree with Theresa\u2019s prescription \u2014 a strategic role for the state to broaden economic opportunity, a clampdown on corporate excesses, rights for workers, intervention in dysfunctional markets and, through school reform, house-building and tax policy, a determination to make Britain the world\u2019s Great Meritocracy \u2014 but it is very difficult to disagree with her diagnosis.\nThat is why the Conservative manifesto, which I authored jointly with the brilliant Ben Gummer, rejected \u2018untrammelled free markets\u2019 and \u2018selfish individualism\u2019, and declared that \u2018our responsibility to one another is greater than the rights we hold as individuals\u2019. I was surprised to read some commentators describe these statements as \u2018left-wing\u2019 when the manifesto was consciously Burkean in its style and substance. Burke\u2019s great revelation was that if we value something, we must be prepared to reform it in order to keep it. I fear the election will cause many to conclude that we should return to the modern consensus politics of pure social and economic liberalism, which I believe is one of the causes of the division we see in Britain today.\nThe manifesto was later written off as \u2018the worst in history\u2019. One of the criticisms is that, instead of offering voters giveaways and bribes, we spelt out where cuts would fall.

Somehow we have reached a point where older people with assets expect younger, poorer people to pay for their care. With Britain\u2019s demographics, that is not sustainable; neither is it socially just.\nPersonal attacks come with the job when you work in government, but at times like these, you find out who your true friends are, and you realise that the people who are hurt most by the criticism are your loved ones.

When considering an mHealth weight loss program, healthcare practitioners should look for one that has many of the same elements as successful person-to-person individualized programs administered by healthcare professionals, which emphasize a calorie-controlled diet, physical activity, self-monitoring or recording food intake and physical activity in a paper or digital diary, personalized feedback and social support.\nPhysical activity \u2014While the majority of studies show that using an online program boosted physical activity more than not using one, there hasn\u2019t been enough research to show whether wearable physical activity monitoring devices actually help you move more.\nSmoking cessation \u2014Mobile phone apps using text messaging to help quit smoking can almost double your chances of quitting, but about 90 percent of people using these apps fail to quit smoking after six months. Mobile health apps used in combination with a traditional quit-smoking program may help smokers kick the habit.\nCurrently, there is little or no U.S.-based mHealth technology research on diabetes, blood pressure or cholesterol management.\nStatement authors reviewed mHealth randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses from the last decade.

{"prefix": "Richards Bay is joining other coastal cities and building a desalination plant to survive the crippling drought. By converting sea water into fresh, the plant will allow the town to tap into what engineers refer to as an \u201calmost infinite\u201d water resource.\nBut water and sanitation officials say the option is one of \u201clast resort\u201d and has come about because of slow work by the water department on other projects.\nThe water department\u2019s own plans show that desalination was seen as a last resort \u2013 becaue it is so expensive and uses so much electricity. Research by the Water Research Commission breaks this down: the City of Cape Town can produce water for R1.25 a kilolitre using a mix of water sources, while Rand Water in Gauteng can produce water for R2.50 per kilolitre.\nBut a large desalination plant along the coast produces water at anywhere between R5.80 and R8.30 per kilolitre.\nBig plants, such as the one being built in Lamberts Bay in the Western Cape, use huge amounts of electricity to remove salt from seawater so that it can be drunk safely. A conventional water treatment plant uses 0.3 kilowatt-hours of electricity to treat a cubic metre of water, while a desalination plant uses up to eight kilowatt-hours of electricity.\nIn its desalination strategy, the water department notes that while the process \u201ccould provide an unlimited resource of freshwater\u201d, it would only be considered after all other options. This is because of the escalating cost of electricity and the lack of a local desalination-plant industry and expertise.\nOther options would include, for instance, treating sewage water back to drinking water, a much cheaper process in terms of electricity and cost. An attempt to do this in Durban was rejected by the local community, which refused to drink the water on religious grounds. There is also the option of fixing old water infrastructure in municipalities, where up to a quarter of the water is lost through leaks.\nBut the decision to desalinate seems to be the result of delays to other infrastructure projects. An official at the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority says desalination \u201cwas always going to be the technology of choice, in the future\u201d. The statement is based on documents such as government\u2019s 2012 National Water Resource Strategy. This master plan looked at how much water each town and city needed, and how much the water department could supply up to 2035.\nFor most cities, water use was projected to outstrip supply before that date. In Johannesburg and Cape Town, that crunch would come before the end of this decade. For Durban and areas such as Richards Bay, people and industry were already using more water than was available by 2005.\nSolving that problem has been the job of the water department, through agencies such as the Tunnel Authority. Mega-projects, such as the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, fall under its purview. This critical scheme is half a decade behind schedule.\nAlthough there are 4 400 registered dams across South Africa, the country\u2019s water security relies on fewer than 50. Upgrades to these dams, such as that planned for the Tzaneen Dam in Limpopo, have been delayed by years or indefinitely postponed. Upgrades to Hazelmere Dam, which supplies Durban", "gold_completion": " and the North Coast, were delayed by six months last year. De Hoop Dam \u2013 opened by the president with much fanfare three years ago \u2013 has been similarly delayed by half a decade.\nThese infrastructure delays mean that when a drought hits, there is not enough water stored to get communities such as Richards Bay through the dry times. Mhlathuze Water, which supplies the area, implemented rolling restrictions last year. Similar restrictions in the 2009 drought saw emergency desalination plants built in Mossel Bay, Sedgefield and Plettenberg Bay. The Hillcrest aluminium smelter in Richards Bay opened its own plant last year, at a cost of R74-million.\nNevertheless, the expense is expected to be high, because the technology is still developing. If other water supply projects had been done on time, South Africa might have been able to avoid the cost for now.\nThe water affairs department had not responded to requests for comment by the time of publication.", "no_wm_completion": " with fresh water, are due to be completed only after the 2040s.\nAnother major project in the pipeline, which has been held up in political opposition, is the Northern Water Retention Scheme.

Water engineers project that the scheme will be completed by the end of this decade, but for the time being the project has been held back due to political opposition by the provincial and national governments.\nThe Vereeniging Riverbed is considered to be at a \u201ccritical point\u201d because it has already been depleted by years of drought.\nHowever, the Vereeniging River is also crucial to the livelihood of the thousands of people living downstream from dams.

If you\u2019re talking about 10 kilometres of shaft into the ocean, that's a considerable distance and would be expensive to install. If you need more desalinity, how about going deeper? A 20-year study shows desalination at sea level requires more energy than at sea level,\u201d Water Research Commission (WRC) report author Derek Doolan notes.\nIf the water department opts for desalinisation at sea level, its facilities on the east coast will be subject to more frequent storm surges.

{"prefix": "To get across Dublin city from, for example, St Vincent\u2019s University Hospital on the southside to Beaumont on the northside or to Connolly in the west could take 30 minutes at a quiet time of the day. At rush hour, it could take double that or even more.\nWith that in mind, nursing organisations are asking why would the Government be looking for a provision in a controversial new contract that would allow nurses working in Dublin to be moved between locations on opposite sides of the capital during a single shift, given the practical difficulties that may present.\nNursing unions and public service management will on Tuesday attend the Labour Court in a bid to resolve differences on a new contract which have complicated and could even threaten the proposed settlement to the recent nurses\u2019 strike.\nThe introduction of a new contract formed a key element of the original Labour Court recommendation that led to the suspension of the strike.\nNurses had been seeking pay parity with other graduate-entry groups such as physiotherapists who, they maintained, earn about \u20ac7,000 a year more.\nUnder the proposals, a new enhanced nurse grade would be introduced to which nurses could migrate after three years. Those moving on to the new grade would receive a salary increase of \u20ac2,439 or 7.3 per cent. The deal would also see significantly more nurses qualifying for additional allowances. However, there were also to be new cost-saving measures in a new contract to offset the cost of the proposed deal which could run to \u20ac50 million by the end of 2020.\nThe Irish Nurses\u2019 and Midwives\u2019 Organisation (INMO) initially urged members to back the Labour Court recommendation. However, when the Government\u2019s contract proposals were leaked, they caused consternation.\nThe Irish Times reported at the beginning of March that the Government wanted provisions to transfer nurses between locations \u2013 potentially within a 40km radius \u2013 for weeks at a time or even within a single shift.\nThe Government proposals could also see nurses rostered to work shifts lasting four, six, eight, 10 or 12 hours.\nThe INMO had seen the new contract as a potential opportunity to modernise nursing practices. However, it contended the Government proposals would actually worsen existing working arrangements.\nThe proposals were rejected by both the INMO and Siptu.\nWhile Government representatives agreed to some changes in the proposals during direct talks with unions and at the Workplace Relations Commission, they insisted on retaining provision for the roster reforms and to move nurses between locations.\nThis is the impasse that the Labour Court will seek to break this week.\nThe question as to why the Government has insisted on such controversial changes which potentially could jeopardise an overall agreement has been debated widely in industrial relations circles in recent weeks.\nSome believe the Government\u2019s target in its contract proposals is not actually the nurses but rather the wider public service trade union movement.\nFrom the start of the process, the Government was determined a settlement to the nurses\u2019 dispute would not cause a breakdown in the existing public service accord, leading to a pay free-for-all across the State sector.\nHowever, the other public service unions have so far held off on launching their much-anticipated knock-on claims. But they have not gone away. They are watching developments very carefully to see how any eventual nurse settlement plays out.\nSo what will the nurses have to give in productivity or work-practice changes in return for additional payments?\nSome senior industrial relations figures believe the Government is sending a message to the broader public service union movement that if", "gold_completion": " they seek more money outside the terms of the current accord, it will come at a price of work-practice reforms that they may find unpalatable.\nIn the meantime, the INMO is expected to argue that seeking nurses to relocate up to 40km is not feasible and would, in essence, discourage recruitment when the health service badly needs to attract more staff and hold on to those it already has.\nThe union is also understood to be greatly concerned at the proposed roster changes.

Jeb Bush put an end to race-based admissions has shown, instead of a decrease in minority enrollment, an increase of 12 percent.\nMr. Bush, whose plan allows the admission of the top 20 percent of graduating seniors from each state high school, whether predominantly black, white or Hispanic, said the increase was proof that diversity in other college systems could be accomplished without affirmative action.\n''The most diverse in history,'' Mr. Bush said of the incoming freshmen, who are the first students to be admitted without affirmative action mandates since racial set-asides were put in place in Florida in 1978.\nHe said his plan, called One Florida, produced an incoming class of more than 40 percent minorities -- blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans -- and could be a model for other states whose affirmative action laws are being challenged in the courts or at the polls.\nBut critics of the plan say it is far too soon, after one year, to call the plan a success. Some experts on education reform called the new system a gimmick that simply gives affirmative action a new name.\nMr. Bush dismissed the criticism as he celebrated what he said was a clear victory in a difficult social and political arena. Black leaders here had said the plan would cripple college admissions of blacks.\n''I've spent the last 10 months getting blistered by people who didn't believe we could do this,'' Mr. Bush said.\nUnlike in Texas and California, which have similar programs that produced initial drops in minority enrollment, ''we did not wait for a legal challenge or a ballot initiative,'' said Mr. Bush.\nTexas courts threw out affirmative action laws in 1996, but the state eventually restored its racial mix on college campuses under a plan in Texas under Gov. George W. Bush that admitted the top 10 percent of students in each school.\nJeb Bush said he used elements of the Texas plan in his own. But it was California's end to affirmative action, in a statewide vote in 1997, that may have forced the Florida governor's hand.\nWard Connerly, a businessman and black conservative who led the battle to end affirmative action in California, had turned his attentions to Florida, and Mr. Bush's One Florida plan was seen as a way to blunt that looming battle in a year that his brother was running for president.\nCritics of the plan, who fought against it when Mr. Bush unveiled it in November, said it is too soon to claim victory, and said the affirmative action program he ended was already steadily improving minority enrollment.\nMr. Bush said the Florida plan does something old affirmative action did not do: It allows students to pursue an education without the stigma of set-asides and lowered admission standards.\n''Every student entering our system today can be proud of what we accomplished, and be confident that achievement, not skin color or ethnic background, is the only measure of merit in our universities,'' he said.\nOf the 3,202 incoming students, 1,234 were minorities, and all 10 colleges in the state system increased their enrollment of blacks, according to statistics from the university system.\nThat increase of black enrollment was not just at predominantly black colleges, but also at Florida's two leading state-run universities -- the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and Florida State University, in Tallahassee.\nThe number of enrolling black students at the University of Florida was up 33 percent from last year, and up 21 percent from last year at Florida State.\nThe number of Hispanic students enrolling at the University of Florida grew by 19 percent, and by 24 percent at Florida State.\nThe two leading universities enrolled 577 more black and Hispanic students this year than last year.\nIn the past, universities had put in place a double standard for minorities, and quotas.\n''Now everybody's in the pool,'' said Carmen Brown", "gold_completion": ", Director of Admissions at Florida International University.\nNo matter how rich or poor the neighborhood a school serves, the top 20 percent of students will be accepted to one of the state's 10 universities.\nMr. Bush said the state's universities aggressively recruited the best minority students who qualified under the plan.\nExperts on education reform said the plan merely renamed affirmative action.\nSam J.

''It's new, and we don't have the time to evaluate it to find out if it's working.''\nBut for the new freshmen, who are white, the changes may be welcomed finally into their family's college experience.\n''A lot of people have said I should be here this year, and that's the one thing I didn't want to hear,'' said Mr. Robinson, who is going to Florida State for her junior year.\n''This is amazing,''", "gen_completion": ", a public policy professor at Florida State who served as dean of the school of public policy and administration at Florida Atlantic University.\nA university policy banned black male students from swimming to the side and blocking white women's paths.

I wonder what we would sing?\" Gallant recalls. \"I thought it would be amazing to have them singing on a Christmas song \u2014 I should write one.\"\nHe'd heard Black Umfolosi before at festivals in Canada and admired their music, which he likens to Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the South African group that shared the spotlight with Paul Simon on his landmark album Graceland.\n\"They were very keen to do it, they immediately said 'Oh yeah we'd love to do that,'\" said Jensen.\nWith them in mind, Gallant quickly penned Christmas Day on Planet Earth during last July's heat wave. He did a rough recording and sent it off to Zimbabwe so the band could learn it.\nWhen the group arrived on P.E.I. in August, they rehearsed a bit with Gallant then headed to a friend's studio barn.\n\"In one day we recorded the song and did a video \u2014 the same day,\" said Gallant.\nAward-winning P.E.I. filmmaker John Hopkins shot the video, while Colin Buchanan of The Hill Sound Studio recorded the song.\n\"That's a lot for anybody in one day, and Lennie is known for being \u2014 in the studio he's very meticulous,\" said Jensen.\nGallant used the nativity story of Mary and Joseph's search for a place to stay Christmas Eve as a theme for the song, connecting it to current global immigration crises including the flight from Syria and the migrant caravan from Central America to the U.S.\n\"Given what's going on in the world right now, with so many desperate families driven from their homes, I thought there's really a connection to be made there with the original Christmas story,\" he said.\n\"These are desperate people, desperate families, and it could be you or I cast in the same situation if the geography was a little bit different.\"\nGallant has worked with several charities including Maritime-Guatemala Breaking the Silence, and plans to give any proceeds from the song to the P.E.I.-based charity Mikinduri Children of Hope, which helps care for people in Kenya. Black Umfolosi also works with many charities in Africa, Jensen said.\n\"If Mary and Joseph were showing up at some countries right now, certainly including the United States of America, they would definitely be turned back,\" added Jensen. \"The message is timely and it's delivered in a beautiful way.\"\n\"Reaction to the song and the video has been quite extraordinary so far,\" Gallant said.\n\"And with Black Umfolosi, they were so wonderful to work with \u2014 such gentle, beautiful people and were very much into it and so patient,\" he said.\nGallant predicts the song, available on iTunes and on streaming services, \"will make no money whatsoever probably, because basically on streaming services you're pretty much", "gold_completion": " giving it away.\"\n\"But I wanted people to hear it, and I'm hoping that it moves people to think about what's going on in the world.\"\nJensen said he believes the song is catchy and could become a holiday classic.\n\"I would not be at all surprised if it became, at least in Canada, a kind of Christmas standard that you start hearing every year.\"\nHe also said he hopes the African group becomes more widely-known from the song.\n\"If this single is out there on commercial radio, it's going to open those guys up to some new listeners,\" Jensen said.\nWant to hear the song in person?

{"prefix": "It\u2019s 2024: Guess What\u2019s Not in Your Wallet?\nLast year, one in three victims who had their financial accounts hacked experienced identify fraud, according to a recent study from the National Consumer League.\nData breaches have become so prevalent that they&apos;ve grown to be part of the public consciousness, and they haven&apos;t shifted our purchasing methods: Americans continue to whip out plastic 66% of the time we make a purchase.\nThe convenience and habit of credit cards outweigh the potential risk of having your identity stolen or bank account sucked dry. In addition, Javelin senior analyst Nick Holland points out that \u201cconsumers have a short memory, [and are also] well-protected by their credit card companies\u201d in terms of limiting their liability for unauthorized purchases.\nHolland explains that even though we reacted with \"shock and horror\" following the massive Target (NYSE:TGT) data breach at the end of 2013, there is an upside: The incident forced the public and the government to finally address the vulnerabilities of our current system.\nHaving to sign a receipt for a purchase will eventually go the way of transistor radios and flip phones. You know those electronic signature pads at many checkouts? In Holland\u2019s words, signing one is \u201clike a drunk writing on an Etch-a-Sketch.\u201d Not only does it not remotely resemble your actual handwriting, it\u2019s barely legible. (When is the last time the clerk even bothered to compare it to the signature on the back of your credit card?) Using your fingerprint would be a lot safer. The folks at Apple have already anticipated this and have added a fingerprint scanner to new iPhones. Your voice might also be used to authenticate your purchase down the road.\nFive years from now, the study forecasts all types of electronic payments to increase as cash purchases fall to 17% and checks to 5%.\nFrom the consumer\u2019s perspective, consider the everyday example of putting gas in your car. If you\u2019re paying by cash, you fill your tank, walk into the store, stand in line to pay and wait for the cashier to make change. Compare this to driving up to the pump, swiping your credit card and immediately driving away after you fill up.\nThere\u2019s also the \u201cup-spend\u201d factor: If you\u2019re using plastic, your spending is not limited by the amount of cash in your wallet.\nHolland adds that electronic transactions are \u201can international leveler.\u201d If you have a credit card, travel outside the U.S. no longer requires you to bring a wad of foreign currency or travelers checks. Likewise, foreign visitors to this country can swipe their American Express card and pay it off in their country&apos", "gold_completion": ";s currency when they get home.\nThe growth in electronic transactions is not just coming from increased use of credit, debit or gift cards. According to Holland, there has also been \u201ca broadening of electronic products\u201d beyond those that typically come to mind. For instance, he says branded pre-paid cards from MasterCard and Visa are bringing the advantages of electronic transactions \u201cto people who would typically not qualify for a checking account....These are really sophisticated products.\"\nLook at it this way: Your mobile phone already provides you with special offers, coupons and purchasing incentives that you don\u2019t get with cash or checks. These types of value-added services increase loyalty and sales- two things highly desired by retailers.\n1. Electronic transactions also reduce employee theft and get the revenue into the business\u2019 bank account faster. Plus, there\u2019s no need to make a trip to the bank.

The National Consumer League predicts that we will see the total global number of retail purchases decline by 35% in five years\u2014mostly because Americans will find a way to make their purchases with their credit cards. They may even make them themselves: Credit card fraud as an overall expense will decline in the United States and worldwide by 50% from 2012 levels, and the average cost of fraud will decline by over 65%, according to Javelin.\nBut we\u2019re not there yet. There are still too many Americans who think they can \u201cdo their own thing,\u201d and use cash to pay bills, and don\u2019t realize just how vulnerable they are. Some people have heard the words \u201ccard-not-present,\u201d but never really experienced it first hand. And credit card companies don\u2019t want them to.\nBut it\u2019s going to take more than that to prevent identity theft\u2014we\u2019", "gen_completion": ";s currency.\nWhat Does That Mean for Credit Card Industry?\nSo what impact is an electronic payment system going to have on U.S. credit card issuers?\nAccording to Tom Adams, former CEO and general partner at RenaissanceCo, credit card issuers have three choices: 1. They can focus entirely on electronic payment systems, which accounts for approximately 45% of all credit card transactions. 2. They can keep their systems, which accounts for another 20%, and hope they capture a small percentage of the digital payment market. 3. They can keep the status quo. \u201cIf they believe their customers don\u2019t want (it), don\u2019t offer it,\u201d Adams says.\nHolland says it\u2019s easy to see where credit card issuers would want to keep the status quo.

Typically, when the assessed value goes up dramatically for a big multi-tenant commercial building, the property owner isn\u2019t the one on the hook for the bill \u2014 it\u2019s the tenants.\nSylvester, who previously sat on the B.C. Assessment Board and the Downtown Vancouver Business Improvement Association, said she\u2019s been discussing the idea with various people recently, including, just in the last week, the former chair of B.C. Assessment, and a provincial cabinet minister.\nBut property-tax agent Paul Sullivan said while the idea is \u201cnot without merit,\u201d there are some", "gold_completion": " challenges.\n\u201cOur community retailers and local independent business are paying too much,\u201d said Sullivan, a senior partner with Burgess, Cawley, Sullivan & Associates. \u201cSo from that perspective, it\u2019s good. The difficulty with it, like so many other propositions around a different class, is how are we going to define it? How are we going to define what a local independent business is? Is it square feet? Number of stores, number of employees, volume of sales?\nSylvester said details would need to be worked out around defining what constitutes a locally owned small business, but she pointed to the precedent in the federal income tax system, where small businesses receive different tax treatment.\nAmy Robinson, executive director of LOCO B.C., an organization representing the independent business community, said tax reform is needed, because recent studies have shown Vancouver businesses pay a higher portion of the property tax burden than other Canadian cities, as compared with residents.", "no_wm_completion": " issues with it, including who would be responsible.\n\u201cWho is going to be responsible for paying this?

And it\u2019s not going to provide relief to the whole community.\u201d\nSullivan said some exemptions will likely remain for multi-unit buildings and hotels.\nThe proposed new structure is still being drafted and could look like other proposed tax breaks for people with low incomes, said Sylvester. She said her proposal is based largely on what other businesspeople have told her.\n\u201cOne of the things that I think we don\u2019t think about enough are these people who are really trying to make ends meet with three incomes,\u201d Sylvester said. \u201cWe haven\ufffd"}

As 60 photos showing the duke and his new wife meeting the Nazi leadership sell at auction for \u00a36,830, BBC News examines the story behind the pictures.\nThe unofficial royal visit to Germany caused much controversy and the former King Edward VIII has since faced numerous accusations of being a Nazi sympathiser.\nHowever, royal historian Carolyn Harris said his motives were \"peaceful\" and linked to the acceptance of his new wife, the American divorcee Wallis Simpson, for whom he had abdicated as king in 1936.\nShe said the duke was \"eager to carve out a new role for himself and ensure that his wife was treated as a full member of the Royal Family even though she had not received the title of Her Royal Highness - an issue that was of great concern to the duke\".\nShe added: \"There was no precedent for an abdicated sovereign assuming an active public role on behalf of the current sovereign and the Duke of Windsor was frustrated that he appeared to be expected to live a quiet life in exile.\"\nSo the duke jumped at the chance to go to Germany when invited by its government, even though the British government did not support his decision and would have preferred the couple keep a low profile.\nHis equerry Sir Dudley Forwood, who compiled the photo album, also said years later the unofficial trip was not a bid to support the Nazi regime, but instead to enable the duchess to experience a state visit.\nTimothy Medhurst, of Duke's Auctions in Dorchester, Dorset, said the images showed the couple \"in a relaxed environment being shown around by Nazis who are clearly proud of their nation\".\n\"It is a unique piece of history compiled at a time when the Nazi war machine was preparing for European conquest and the systematic slaughter of millions of people,\" he added.\nImage caption Royal historian Carolyn Harris said the duke's motives for visiting members of the Nazi regime were \"peaceful\"\nMs Harris, who specialises in European monarchy, said: \"The Duke of Windsor was familiar with Germany - he had numerous relatives there - and seems to have envisioned a diplomatic role for himself as a mediator between Britain and Germany.\"\nHe shared the views of other senior figures in the British government \"who thought a lasting peace could be negotiated through diplomacy\", she said.\nAccording to royal biographer Andrew Morton, he officially went there to look at housing conditions, an issue that he had been interested in when he was king.\n\"But the real reason was to show Wallis a good time and see exactly what it was like to enjoy a royal tour, and they were treated like royalty,\" he said.\n\"She was treated like a royal princess, not like the Royal Family treated her, like an outcast and an outsider.\n\"In Germany members of the aristocracy would bow and curtsy towards her, and she was treated with all the dignity and status that the duke always wanted.\"\nMr Morton added that despite being \"thrilled\" at the time, the couple later realised they had made a \"ghastly mistake\" after their actions upset American trade unions and Jewish organisations.\nThe trip did not mean the duke was a Nazi, he said", "gold_completion": ".\n\"But he was certainly sympathetic... even after the war he thought Hitler was a good fellow and that he'd done a good job in Germany, and he was also anti-Semitic, before, during and after the war.\"\nMs Harris told BBC News that in 1939, when war was imminent, the duke contacted Hitler \"hoping to negotiate a peaceful solution, attempting to draw upon the rapport they developed during the 1937 visit\".\nHowever, she said his ties with Nazi Germany \"made him a liability\" for Britain during World War Two, which led to his appointment as Governor of the Bahamas \"which removed him from Europe for the remainder of the war\".\nBut Edward and Wallis \"continued to cause anxiety for the British government\" during their time in the Bahamas \"as their visits to the United States attracted an enormous amount of public attention and the Duke of Windsor expressed pessimism about an English victory\".\nWhat is the context of the royal 'Nazi salute' film?", "no_wm_completion": ", but they are both said to have been fascinated by Hitler and Germany and did not necessarily share the same attitude as others who met him.\nThe German royal photographer Hermann Eder, known as the \"Hitler of the Weimar Republic\", took a series of shots of the couple during their trip to Germany.\nThe duke's photographs were donated to a public library in Florida in 1968 and the Duke's Auctions say they had not been viewed in full for almost 50 years.\nThe sale, organised by the charity Diana, Prince of Wales' Award for Volunteering (DPA), is also helping to raise funds for DPA programmes to help young volunteers find employment or volunteer placements.\nIf you would like to bid for the images, click here.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Very little is known about the virus even though more than 50 years have passed since it was discovered in the Zika Forest in Uganda.\nUntil recently, Zika was expected to cause little more than flu-like symptoms \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists fever, joint pain and a headache \u2014 in about 20 percent of the people it infected.\nThe rapid spread of the virus and potential connection to an otherwise rare birth defect have drawn plenty of attention from the public and from government officials.\nIn January, the National Institutes of Health made Zika virus research a high priority, and the groundwork underway at UW\u2013Madison led to NIH support for a series of studies of the virus in macaques, monkeys whose physiology and immune systems are similar to humans.\nThe researchers will track the effects of initial infections, but also try to establish whether one Zika virus infection provides some protection against future infection \u2014 like chicken pox does.\nZika does not mutate particularly fast, the feature of HIV and influenza that makes those viruses hard to pin down with vaccines (like HIV) and leaves people open to reinfection seasonally (like flu). This may make Zika easier to head off with a vaccine, but the best sort of immune response to provoke with a vaccine is not yet", "gold_completion": " known.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to have data that shows what natural immunity looks like and the sort of immune responses that arise to protect an individual when they encounter that virus again,\u201d O\u2019Connor says.\nPerhaps more hotly anticipated will be results from planned studies of Zika and pregnancy.\nOr whether the timing of the infection during pregnancy matters. Or whether it is direct infection of a developing fetus by the virus or the immune response the infection sparks in pregnant women that causes problems like microcephaly.\nWorking with the Zika virus from the original 1947 discovery in Africa and from the ongoing South American outbreak \u2014 provided by UW\u2013Madison Osorio and Aliota, who were first to identify Zika virus circulating in Colombia in October \u2014 the researchers also hope to identify any important differences in infection by the different strains.\nO\u2019Connor also hopes results from the studies will help settle minds around the world, and help change the tenor of Zika news stories.", "no_wm_completion": " being tested in monkeys.\nIf there\u2019s a clear protection, the next step would be to test it in the broader monkey population. But even if there\u2019s no special protection, such vaccines would still have to be tested on humans for effectiveness before they can be approved for commercial use.\nIn the meantime, it is also of interest whether the virus itself mutates in any way, which could impact future prevention efforts.\nOnce the monkeys are tested, researchers will use the data to evaluate immune responses in pregnant women who have been infected with Zika in Colombia, as well as women in the U.S. infected by people in Central America and Brazil, the areas at greatest risk.\nThe data will also help guide possible prevention efforts, such as using pregnant women who have had any form of Zika infection to give birth to fetuses at risk because of microcephaly.\nAs for studying Zika itself, more research will be needed on whether one Zika infection in a monkey", "gen_completion": " being widely recognized.\nIn fact, people infected but with no measurable illness may not be protected against future Zika infection, the group also suggests.\nTo establish this type of link, the researchers plan to apply the technique of RNA polymerase chain reaction (RNA-PCR) to genes known to be associated with the Zika virus infection, along with other markers of the virus itself. Genetic material will be extracted from the monkey tissue and sequenced to examine whether the virus was present at the time of the first immune reaction.\nThe researchers have begun the long process of recruiting monkeys for this project, which the University of Wisconsin Public Health Service has helped to fund through funds provided by the state of Washington.\nOsorio notes it\u2019s unlikely that genetic markers alone will lead his group to more accurate information about Zika infection. That comes through \u201cexamining what happens to the virus after the first immune response is triggered,\u201d he says. Once the first immune responses in monkeys have"}

He drove, Tim sat in the passenger seat and me in back, trying to manage a super 8mm movie camera with one hand and a tape recorder with the other. Albert told us that we were driving the route of his first LSD trip in 1943, when he bicycled home with his Sandoz lab assistant after testing 250 micrograms. Tim cracked up when I asked Albert if he still had the bicycle. I knew it was gauche of me, but I couldn't resist. A short time later Albert pulled over.\"\nHere is an excerpt of the conversation between Albert and Tim, after they picked us up at the train station. On the way to Albert's estate we passed by his 1943 home.\nAt Wired, Greg Miller writes about Timothy Leary's journey from scientist to \"psychedelic celebrity\", revealed in new detail by the release of his archives.\nLeary may be best known for his role in the psychedelic movement of the \u201960s, but in his later years, at the dawn of the internet age he became fascinated by the potential of technology to transform human communication (see the related gallery on video games and other software from Leary\u2019s archives). He also became interested in life extension and space migration, which he discussed in an exchange of letters with astronomer Carl Sagan.\nA previously unknown connection between Czech dissident Vaclav Havel and American psychologist Timothy Leary is revealed by an inscribed copy of Leary's 1977 Neuropolitics.\nMichael Horowitz*, Timothy Leary's longtime archivist, has permitted the Timothy Leary Archives website to publish a transcription of a tape recorded conversation between Dr. Leary and his wife Rosemary, and John Lennon and Yoko Ono, made during John and Yoko's Bed-In for Peace in Montreal, May 1969.

This new transcript, taken from the tape, is a valuable addition to previously-published versions of the recording, and in its entirety, for the first time.\n\"We are having our own version of the Bed-In for Peace,\" says John Lennon in the conversation. \"We'll be in each other's company, and I can understand Yoko very well. And it's just very peaceful. And they're speaking to each other as, you know, brothers and sisters.\nTimmy gets out of the car.\nTimmy: \"The one thing that people don't understand about peace is that you can't make peace with other people without their consent\u2026 We've come out", "gen_completion": ", upon his completion of the postgraduate course at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in which Michael was a fellow student.

Michael writes:\n\"I had previously been unable to obtain the original recording of The Beatles in studio 8E/3A. I made my first attempt to obtain it in 1977/78 at the time Timothy Leary was writing and researching a book about psychedelic drugs with Dr. Robert J. Sullivan.

Your skin begins to tingle as you approach the room as soon as the canisters are opened.\nAs you step inside the back of your neck feels hot. The muffled yells of the instructor order you to remove your mask. The first deep breath without a gas mask creates an uncomfortable situation.\nSoldiers of Echo Company, 65th Brigade Engineer Battalion, 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, conducted Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear training (CBRN) on Feb. 5, here on Schofield Barracks, Hawaii.\nThe training is done to prepare Soldiers for chemical attacks. Chlorobenzylidene malononitrile, commonly referred to as CS gas or tear gas is used to train Soldiers within the gas chamber.\nSoldiers began the morning by lining up outside of the chamber doing checks on their masks to ensure their equipment works properly.\n\"Having confidence in your equipment is what can ultimately determine mission success,\" said Command Sgt. Maj. Sean Horval, senior enlisted advisor of 2IBCT \"There is always a chance that with future conflicts, chemicals could be involved. It is always smart to prep for the worst. If or when something does happen,we are ready.\"\nAfter lining up, Soldiers are instructed to make sure their masks have a good seal. By ensuring the masks are properly sealed, the mask is able to do its job in regulating clean air through the user.\nUpon entering, Soldiers are ordered to break the seals on their mask, re-seal their masks and then fully remove their masks before exiting the chamber.\n\"My eyes were burning, they started watering,\" said Pvt. Jeremiah Cannon, a mechanic assigned to Echo Co. \"After taking our masks off, we were told to explain why we joined the Army as a test to see how long we could take the gas. I could barely get my answer out, my lungs were burning.\"\nThe exit to the gas chamber suddenly opened and the Soldiers poured out as quickly as they could squeeze through the door.\nInstructors began yelling out \"Don't touch your eyes or your face!\" to prevent Soldiers from rubbing more of the irritating contaminant on their bodies.\n\"The training is great in that it allows Soldiers to build proficiency in the event of a nuclear, biological or chemical", "gold_completion": " attack,\" said 2nd Lt.

Within a short period of trying on masks and entering the gas chamber, Soldiers are exiting the gas chamber for the next iteration of individuals to test their fortitude against the uncomfortable gas.\n\"CBRN training is designed to make Soldiers comfortable with being uncomfortable,\" explained Horval. \"If an attack were to ever happen, these Soldiers can rely on their training to save their lives and to continue to push for mission success.\"", "no_wm_completion": " attack,\" said Lt.

They take the door off the shelter to allow smoke or gas from occurring while clearing the others out. If need be, more troops will enter the shelter from the back to attempt to reach more individuals.\nSoldiers leave a safe distance from all of the equipment, including the shelter in case the attack turns violent.\n\"In a combat attack we can't get anywhere near where the target is,\" Cannon said. \"Being able to survive to evacuate the unit is the most important thing.\"\nCannon and Cannon, along with seven others, went out to a bunker in February with two other companies to complete a", "gen_completion": " attack,\" added Lt.

It is there where she is first approached by Will (Cole Sprouse, TV\u2019s \u201cRiverdale\u201d), though they maintain a distance mandated by their shared battles with cystic fibrosis.\nNaturally, the typical teenage cat-and-mouse antics ensue, but in this case, a distinct hint of Russian roulette is propositioned as well.

{"prefix": "1947: Capt. Charles E. \u201cChuck\u201d Yeager pilots the rocket-powered Bell X-1 to a speed of Mach 1.07, becoming the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound. In breaking the sound barrier, Yeager becomes the fastest man alive \u2014 and the legend of the X-Planes begins.\nAs airplanes flew faster and faster throughout the 1930s, pilots began to experience a number of problems associated with the increased airspeed. Aircraft such as the Lockheed P-38 and Republic P-47 flew just fine at ordinary speeds in level flight. But if pilots put them in a high-speed dive, they began to experience control problems that led to the deaths of several pilots.\nThe main problem facing these pilots was the aerodynamic condition known as compressibility. Simply stated, at speeds well below the speed of sound, most of the air molecules have time to get out of the way of an aircraft as it approaches, and the density of the air does not change.\nHowever, as the speed of sound is approached, the air molecules can\u2019t get out of the way, and more of them hit the aircraft. The impact compresses the air in front of the aircraft and increases the air density. Eventually shock waves form around the airplane, affecting the lift and drag. These changes were not well-understood and led to the loss of control in several aircraft.\nBecause the effects of compressibility are directly related to the speed of sound, a ratio is used to describe the speed of an aircraft. The Mach number is the speed at which an object is traveling relative to the speed of sound at a particular temperature. The name is in honor of physicist Ernest Mach, who studied high-speed gas dynamics.\nThe Bell X-1 was developed to research aerodynamics in the transonic region, or speeds just below and just above the speed of sound. After numerous flights with civilian test pilots, Capt. Yeager of the newly formed U.S. Air Force made his first powered flight in the X-1 on Aug. 29, 1947, high over the Mojave Desert of southern California.\nThe problem Yeager was experiencing was the ineffectiveness of the X-1\u2019s pitch controls, as shock waves essentially created an aerodynamic shadow around the tail. Changes were made to the horizontal tail controls, allowing Yeager to control the airplane's ability to pitch up and down, and flights continued. This knowledge would lead to the all-flying tail, or stabilator, standard on all supersonic fighters today.\nYeager was nursing two broken ribs on the morning of Oct. 14, after being thrown from his horse on a ride the night before. He boarded the B-29 bomber that was to carry the Bell X-1 to altitude. The plan was to fly to Mach 0.97. But Yeager says the new moving tail boosted his morale, and he wanted to fly faster.\nAfter climbing down into the X-1, which was carried like a bomb in the belly of the B-29, Yeager\u2019s friend and fellow test pilot Jack Ridley handed him a short, sawed-off section of broomstick. Yeager would use it to close the canopy of the X-1, because his broken ribs prevented him from closing the latch normally.\nPeople on the ground heard what sounded like distant thunder. It was the first sonic boom ever created by an aircraft. At age 24, Yeager had flown faster than the speed of sound.\nThe flight was kept secret, and the world wouldn\u2019t know about the first supersonic", "gold_completion": " flight until months later. The X-1 would fly more than a hundred more times, reaching a speed of Mach 1.45.\nSubsequent X-1 models would fly more than twice the speed of sound. Later X-Planes would fly even faster, reaching hypersonic speeds where the density of the air wasn\u2019t the only thing to change: They would fly so fast, the chemistry of the air would change.\nCapt. Yeager would go on to become Gen. Yeager and the iconic test pilot. He was the first commandant of the Air Force\u2019s test-pilot school and continued commanding fighter squadrons into the 1960s.\nNow age 86, Yeager will return this Saturday to the skies over the Mojave desert. He'll make a now-routine supersonic flyby to kick off Edwards Air Force Base\u2019s air show and open house.\nJune 24, 1947: They Came From...

The Bell X-1 had an alarm that sounded a minute before the plane was to come to a stop.\nBy 1947, American aircraft were equipped with boom detectors. They would continue on, through the 1950s, along with a lot of air traffic control, until the 1970s.\nBut before the boom detectors came along, pilots still managed to pilot larger aircraft"}

After that, the network would charge 5 cents per month per subscriber.\nBlume is projecting 100,000 subscribers by year-end.\nApproximately 4,000 documentaries are produced each year, said Blume, but most are never seen due to a lack of outlets for distribution. True to the network&apos;s tagline, \"Real Life Stories,\" Blume hopes to provide attractive programming that appeals to operators and viewers.\nThe network&apos;s target audience of highly educated, affluent adults aged 25 to 54 is one of the primary audiences to which operators are trying to sell digital services.\n\"We believe that the programming that Chronicle offers is what the cable operators are interested in and where we had the most available programming,\" Blume said.\nSome of the documentaries slated to air on the network include award-winning productions such as Alberta Hunter: My Castle&apos;s Rockin&apos;, which traces the performer&apos;s career throughout the 20th century; A League of Their Own", "gold_completion": ", the documentary that inspired the Penny Marshall film of the same name; and Annie Leibovitz, a profile of the famed photographer.\nThe network will also offer in-depth and controversial documentaries including The Islamic Wave, a film focusing on the relationship between Islam and the West; andShackled Women, a report on human-rights abuses of women from Africa to Asia.\nChronicle DTV was initially part of a suite of digital channels Blume had hoped to launch last year. But the economic downturn and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks severely hampered Blume&apos;s ability to generate the financing necessary to support the suite.\n\"Industry consolidation, including the pending AT&T-Comcast cable deal, kept busy the cable executives that we were hoping to meet with to get the venture off the ground,\" Blume said. \"It&apos;s been a difficult time, but it made us focus on the one network instead of several services.\"", "no_wm_completion": ": The Women that Took on Baseball; The Last Supper: A New Age in Art; and Superheroes: The Secret War for America&apos;s Superheroes.\nThe documentary series will also feature special effects, such as special effects created by FX Productions, Blume said. \"We will do the same special effects in the long format and not even have a box for the long format because we will have so much special effects,\" he said.\nThe Chronicle&apos;s content is produced independently from its partners, including Disney-based ABC International and the BBC&apos;s World Service. It is produced in-house, with the network also carrying specials produced by the World Bank and the United Nations.\nThe network is looking to add more programming.\n\"We are looking for more content, so if someone has a special that we want, we are always willing to work with them because we don&apos;t have the budget", "gen_completion": ": The Untold Story of Women in The NFL; and Hollywood Unearthed: The Untold Secrets of Hollywood&apos; First Movies, which gives a look at some of the people responsible for the studios.\nThe network also will air a series of nonfiction shows called The American Experience, which explores important moments in American civil rights, world history and political and historical significance.\nIn addition, Chronicle&apos;s programming will include shows on American Idol, which chronicles the show&apos;s progress from the time it first aired.\nIn addition to content from the network&apos;s holdings, Chronicle&apos;s content will include a mix of documentaries produced on the ground through its own productions and the work of numerous artists and producers who are guests.\n\"We have a terrific mix of documentaries from across the world with very meaningful storylines and stories about great directors, actors and artists that chronicle our culture and our country,\" said Blume"}
{"prefix": "Swiss power gear company ABB (s abb) has made another investment in tech that can make data centers more energy-efficient. Thursday morning, ABB says it has acquired controlling interest \u2014 through its venture arm (ABB Technology Ventures) \u2014 in Validus DC Systems, an 11-year-old company that makes power systems for data centers that utilize direct current (DC), which can make data centers more energy-efficient.\nI\u2019m hearing the deal is a large \u2014 eight-figure \u2014 buyout of existing shareholders, which included Oak Hill Ventures and Validus management, and a new $8 million Series B investment. The investment could also essentially be a two-step M&A, where ABB would have first dibs to buy the company outright at a later date. Validus previously raised at least $10 million from Oak Hill Ventures.\nValidus DC Systems sells data center power supply systems, along with converters and data center gear, based on DC tech. DC technology is more energy-efficient than AC (there is less energy lost in the transmission) and is also less complex and the gear can be built into smaller spaces. Validus says its DC technology can cut down on the total cost of a data center \u2014 via both energy savings and space savings \u2014 by 30 percent.\nIn addition to energy efficiency, use of DC technology can make a data center more reliable because there are fewer times in the system when the power has to be converted from AC to DC. DC can also pull in solar and wind power directly, though few data center operators are yet utilizing all that much clean power.\nABB already sells data center power gear like power distribution and management systems, emergency back-up power tech, circuit breakers, surge protectors, motors and building control and automation systems. ABB also provides high-voltage DC lines for long distance power transmission and has supplied one of the longest HVDC lines in the world. Adding Validus\u2019 DC products into ABB\u2019s mix is a natural fit.\nABB has also been focused on energy efficiency of data centers in particular. In September, ABB announced it had invested into Valley startup Power Assure, which makes", "gold_completion": " software that can ramp up and down the power consumption of data centers to coincide with server usage. ABB is also working with Emerson and IBM (s IBM) on data center energy efficiency.\nMore and more data center operators and Internet companies are starting to focus on reducing energy consumption as a way to reduce costs. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), data centers account for over two percent of energy consumption in the U.S., and that number is set to grow as more and more people buy up always-on gadgets and constantly connected computers.\nYou\u2019re probably wondering why, if DC technology is so much more energy-efficient than straight AC, don\u2019t most data center operators use this. Basically, the data center world is slow-moving and cautious, and has been using traditional tech for decades. However, now that ABB has substantially supported the technology, you can expect to see a lot more DC data centers out there.\nImage courtesy of The Planet.", "no_wm_completion": " solar AC inverters.\n\u201cWe need to have some systems that can scale \u2014 not for the next year\u2019s server farm or rack, but for data centers,\u201d ABB North America\u2019s CEO Paul Soderlund said at the time. And, with the help of Valley startups, ABB is looking to develop next-generation technologies and drive efficiencies across its data center and power systems portfolio in North America. To do this, ABB is taking one of its new products, the ABB DMI controller, and applying more automation and predictive capabilities to it.\nAt the end of September, ABB announced the launch of a global \u201ccloud of energy,\u201d which the company said was modeled around an energy resource management system that provides utilities with centralized control of power generation and transmission that will enable them to more reliably store and manage their growing renewable power needs.\nAnd earlier this month, ABB announced it was investing in TerraForm Power,", "gen_completion": " solar panels for edge data centers in under-banked urban areas. When ABB built its data centers in cities including Buenos Aires, Singapore and Tokyo, its goal was not to create a data center without the help of the local electricity grid. Because solar farms tend to be located higher up the grid, it\u2019s difficult to get to them \u2014 though ABB has found a way around that (with \u201ctransmission lines\u201d that bring power to the data center). By providing data centers with enough power supply in those areas, ABB\u2019s energy management platform can help them save on costs and the time it takes to build and manage an energy solution. The data center provider added a data center in the US earlier this year, which has been a test bed for its energy management product.\nThere\u2019s some obvious value in having energy efficiencies that a growing number of data centers are requiring.

There's at least one leading veterinary professor, a German named Dr. Gerhard Oechtering, who argues that all short-nosed dogs should be forcibly bred with long-nosed dogs to destroy their inferior genetics.\nDriven by demand for adorably wrinkled dogs with humanlike features, breeders flattened pugs' faces until their sockets were too shallow for their big, round eyes\u2014and until their palates were adorably compacted into their nasal passages, which they would otherwise use to breathe.\nFrom a pug's very first year, it may have to fight for every breath. That lovable snuffle? The poor dog is drowning in plain air, a lifelong snore that infects every breath. Some pugs are so hard up for oxygen they just fall over and faint sometimes.\nMeanwhile, their spines and hips are so weirded up that many of them lose the use of their rear legs late in life.

Mowbray had hoped to hand opportunities to more young of the club\u2019s promising youngsters with seven games remaining, but is reluctant to do that given their current form.\nWhile many fans\u2019 thoughts have already turned to next season, Mowbray admits there is still work to do to finish off this campaign and make sure it doesn\u2019t take a bigger downturn.\nHowever, he believes whether or not the perception of the season would change with a poor finish is for other people to decide.\n\u201cI think so, I think that\u2019s where we are,\u201d Mowbray said of the inability to experiment more.\n\u201cWe have to dig really deep. I know we beat Wigan in our last home game, and our home form has been generally good over the last two years, but we went on a run of losing three home games 1-0 to Preston, Middlesbrough and Bristol City. It shows how attritional this league, how difficult it is.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on a run, the fine margins, or a little bit of confidence or belief can make a huge difference from winning 1-0, to losing 1-0.\n\u201cThose statistics add up and before you know it you can be on a run like we are of one win in 10.\n\u201cMentally it can be damaging on the team.

{"prefix": "Recent reforms were hailed as progress, but advocates say the system is still riddled with problems.\nRecent federal reforms aimed at protecting prisoners from exorbitant phone bills still fall short of reining in prices on the the vast majority of inmate calls, federal officials and prisoners' advocates said Wednesday.\nThe new rules, enacted in February by the Federal Communications Commission, cap prices for out-of-state calls. But most calls from prisoners are in-state communications, which remain unregulated.\nAdvocates say call fees have long been a problem for inmates and their families. Costly charges can leave prisoners with thousands of dollars in phone bills when they get out. In some cases, people have been forced to choose between phone calls and food. And children who lack regular contact with their incarcerated parents are more likely to miss school, become homeless, or suffer depression.\nThe FCC, led by interim Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn, took a step toward addressing that problem last year. The agency's ruling capped prices for interstate phone calls at 21 cents per minute for prepaid calls and 25 cents per minute for collect calls. Previous prices had exceeded $1 a minute in some cases.\nWhen the FCC put forth its original ruling in 2013, it expressed a desire to address in-state rates as well, seeking comment on possible proposals to do so. But the telephone companies that challenged the out-of-state caps have threatened opposition to in-state rules as well, and any FCC attempt to reform them would likely trigger a legal battle over the FCC's jurisdiction.\nBut with in-state calls still unregulated, some prisoners are paying much more for their local calls. In New Jersey, for instance, some in-state calls can run more than $8 for 15 minutes on the phone.\n\"The reforms thus far, though significant, have had very little impact because the majority of inmate calling is intrastate,\" said Darrell Baker, an Alabama utility official who has led that state's push to lower its call rates.\n\"The FCC's decision did a lot, but it certainly didn't help for large numbers of people,\" said Cheryl Leanza, an advocate with the United Church of Christ.\nFCC leaders, including Clyburn, Wheeler, and Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, said last year's reforms are a starting point, but agreed that in-state calls still need to be addressed.\n\"We recognize that more needs to be done,\" FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in his opening remarks at a Wednesday panel at the agency's Washington headquarters.\nThe FCC, however, is asking states to take the lead on intrastate calling. Some states \u2014 including Alabama \u2014 have taken steps to protect prisoners from predatory rates.\nSimilar to the FCC's out-of-state rules, Alabama moved recently to cap in-state call fees at 25 cents per minute.\nBut with most states still inactive on the issue, some are calling for federal intervention.\n\"The FCC has both the duty and the authority to act under the statute if states do not,\" Clyburn said.\nOthers think the FCC's role should be limited advising state officials.\n\"Much of the heavy lifting is now left to the states,\" said Jesse Wiese, who works with the faith-based criminal-justice reform group Justice Fellowship. \"We don't think the commission should regulate intrastate calls.\" Wiese said the agency should focus on working with lawmakers and regulators around the country to enact reforms.\nBut inmate calling problems aren't limited to high intrastate prices. Many prisoners, said panelists, are frequently plagued by dropped calls. Those are generally the fault of", "gold_completion": " three-way detection systems, which exist to prevent prisoners' calls from being routed to another \u2014 unknown \u2014 recipient. The problem is that these systems can be overly sensitive, cutting off calls when they pick up background noise like a child or wind. \"When the call is dropped, the prisoner has to call back again, which leads to another call-hookup fee,\" said Paul Wright, who heads the Human Rights Defense Center.\nBaker added that dropped calls have been the No. 1 complaint among the prisoners with whom he's talked.\nCommissioners also mentioned other priorities in continuing to reform inmate calling services. Wheeler, Clyburn, and Rosenworcel all expressed a desire to make the interstate rate caps permanent. The current figures were set on an interim status as the agency collects more data to set permanent rates.\n\"The relief for family and friends has been tremendous,\" said Clyburn, citing the ruling's early success. \"Call volumes have increased as much as 30 percent.\"", "no_wm_completion": " call centers, which have become a bigger part of the prison-business operation.\nPrisoners say phone systems designed to accommodate prisoners' needs \u2014 often in the form of inmate-dedicated numbers \u2014 don't lend themselves to allowing multiple lines to call simultaneously. Prisoners have to buy additional minutes to make calls on the phone numbers with inmate-dedicated phone lines, or pay a separate monthly fee.

Bannon, the officials said\u2026.After assembling reports that showed that Trump campaign officials were mentioned or inadvertently monitored by U.S. spy agencies targeting foreign individuals, Cohen took the matter to the top lawyer for the National Security Council, John Eisenberg.\nThe third White House official involved was identified as Michael Ellis, a lawyer who previously worked with Nunes on the House Intelligence Committee but joined the Trump administration as an attorney who reports to Eisenberg.\nThis is an amazingly far-reaching conspiracy considering that the documents don\u2019t actually seem to have contained anything very interesting.

{"prefix": "Now, a new study offers insight into why some people shrug off physical touches and how families affected by autism may learn to share hugs without overwhelming an autistic child\u2019s senses.\nYale neuroscientists recruited 19 young adults and imaged their brain activity as a researcher lightly brushed them on the forearm with a soft watercolor paintbrush. In some cases, the brushing was quick, and in others slow: prior studies have shown that most people like slow brushing and perceive it as affectionate contact, while the faster version is felt as less pleasant and more tickle-like.\nNone of the participants in the current study had autism, but the researchers evaluated them for autistic traits \u2014 things like a preference for sameness, order and systems, rather than social interaction. They found that participants with the highest levels of autistic traits had a lower response in key social brain regions \u2014 the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) \u2014 to the slow brushing.\nAccording to Martha Kaiser, senior author of the study and associate director of the Child Neuroscience Laboratory at the Yale Child Study Center, the STS is a critical hub of the social brain. \u201cThis region is important for perceiving the people around us, for visual social stimuli and for perceiving social versus nonsocial sounds,\u201d she says.\nThe current findings suggest that the region is also involved in processing social touch and that its response is linked to the individual\u2019s social ability, she says.\nIf that\u2019s the case, finding ways to make social experience \u2014 including touch \u2014 more rewarding might be one way to help autistic people connect better with others.\nIndeed, Temple Grandin, the well-known author and animal scientist with autism, and the subject of a 2010 HBO biopic, famously built herself a", "gold_completion": " \u201chug machine\u201d to self-apply deep pressure to her body.

Making social touch more rewarding early in development might further help autistic children learn social skills, since learning is heavily dependent on pleasure. And because later development relies on early experience, such a strategy could improve their overall development. \u201cI think there are a lot of potential treatment applications for this work,\u201d Kaiser says.\nThe study was published in Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience.", "no_wm_completion": " hug machine in her San Diego home.\nKaiser says that the study provides new insight into how families may benefit from the Hugger, a hug-like device that is part home and part therapy device.\nAnd it offers hope for families who might feel overwhelmed by a hug, but not want to give it up entirely.\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that people are going to have to relearn the process of giving and receiving hugs,\u201d Kaiser says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a new and challenging skill, but the benefits are huge because people with autism have an amazing capacity to integrate social stimulus, whether it\u2019s touch, smell, sounds or visual stimuli.\u201d\nKaiser notes that autism affects 3.7 percent of children and adults globally. \u201cIf we had 5 or 6 percent that were sensitive to touch, we could really make a dent in the problem,\u201d she says.\nMore on Geek.com:\nHow to", "gen_completion": " hug-machine that made her feel warmth.

{"prefix": "My best friend in college was a straight-A student, an English major. In part he got all A\u2019s because he is whip smart\u2014his essays were systematically better than everyone else\u2019s. But the other reason was that he refused to enroll in a course unless he was certain he would ace it. Consequently, he never really challenged himself to try something beyond his comfort zone. I, on the other hand, was not a straight-A student. My first semester I took atomic physics with Professor Delroy Baugh, self-proclaimed \u201cLaser Guy.\u201d I\u2019d never taken a physics course before in my life, and as a reward for my willingness to transcend my comfort zone I received a D.\nSomewhere between the two of us lies a sweet spot: if you only ever get 100 percent on your tests, they aren\u2019t hard enough. If you never get above 50 percent, you\u2019re probably in the wrong major. The trick is to be right enough, but not so right that you never allow yourself the opportunity to be wrong.\nSo, how wrong should you be?\nWilson and his colleagues derive the number from experiments in machine learning. Under loose assumptions, they show that the optimal error rate for training a broad class of deep learning algorithms is 15 percent. The fastest learning progress occurs when the error rate hits this sweet spot. They show that this number is also in line with previous work on learning in humans and animals.\nThe implications of the 85 percent rule in the classroom are straightforward. If you\u2019re a teacher, your tests should be difficult enough that the average score is 85 percent. If you\u2019re a student, the optimal level of challenge is about a B or a B+ average. An A might look nice on your transcript, but you could have stood to learn more from a class that was harder. Outside the classroom, the implications of the 85 percent rule are similar. If you are learning a new language, say on Duolingo, then you should be getting about 15 percent of the answers wrong. Otherwise, you\u2019re not being challenged at the right level to consistently improve in picking up your new language.\nBut the 85 percent rule only holds for one class of problems, where the point is to build up expertise over many trials. With other kinds of problems you really don\u2019t want to get them wrong at all. For example, should you believe in God? Pascal wagered that you should, because if you don\u2019t there\u2019ll be hell to pay. Most people make up their minds one way about this issue and tend not to change their position too frequently. This presents a paradox: suppose 50 percent of people believe in God and 50 percent don\u2019t. Half are on the side opposite the truth. Yet no matter what evidence you present them with they won\u2019t admit they\u2019re wrong. In this case we see an error rate of zero. Why is no one ever wrong about their belief in God?\nHere another answer comes from cognitive science, in a paper by Samuel Gershman of Harvard University titled \u201cHow to Never Be Wrong.\u201d In the paper Gershman considers the problem of auxiliary hypotheses. The idea is that any given theory comes with a set of undisclosed assumptions, which can protect the core theory from being disproved. For example, the seven-day creation story of Genesis is at odds with the fossil record. So if you accept the fossil record, do you have to forfeit Genesis?\nNope. All you have to do is note that a \u201cday\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be 24 hours\u2014especially not if God hasn\u2019t created", "gold_completion": " the sun and moon yet. The definition of day is merely an auxiliary hypothesis of the core theory that God created the world. Such auxiliary hypotheses form a \u201cprotective belt\u201d around the core theory, deflecting contrary evidence from pesky one-offs, such as a handful of really old rocks, while leaving the main argument unscathed.\nBut never being wrong isn\u2019t an especially good thing. To the contrary, being wrong is important because it is the first step on the way to being right. If you\u2019re never wrong, you never learn anything you didn\u2019t already know. So whether you\u2019re taking a test from the Laser Guy or reconsidering your slate of metaphysical tenets, getting a few answers wrong is like salting a meal: a little bit makes the whole thing better, just don\u2019t take it too far.\nCody Kommers worked in the Computational Cognitive Neuroscience lab at Harvard University. He lives in Boston.", "no_wm_completion": " the solar system or the universe yet. Then you get to a point in your hypothesis where there\u2019s some ambiguity regarding the number of days left. You can add up the number of days in your hypothesis and see (satisfyingly) that it doesn\u2019t come out to seven because you\u2019re not sure if your hypothesis is correct. So even though you may have been wrong about whether God created the universe, you still got there first. But why didn\u2019t you get there first if God did? He probably got there first in a smaller sense.\nThis leads to the 85 percent idea. The more uncertain you are about your beliefs, the less likely you are to get them wrong. What we really need to do to build that expertise is try to build the confidence level by avoiding getting them wrong at all costs.\nThis is where what Wilson calls \u201csoft intelligence\u201d comes into play. Soft intelligence goes beyond making the number 85 percent. It", "gen_completion": " a 365-day day in his plan. If so, you would have to conclude that there isn\u2019t a day seven days in a row. You would have to conclude, as Gershman does, that a day is just a variable that can vary, that is it has no fixed period. If this happens you would also have to conclude that God may have skipped days in his design\u2014and God did skip some of them. To me, Gershman concludes that no one will ever be 100 percent right in that situation.\nOne issue regarding the 85 percent rule is epistemic humility, a lack of confidence in your own views. A teacher who doesn\u2019t believe is still capable of doing a great job, but the less confident you are, the less you\u2019re gonna get right. In my first year of college I studied religion.

Anticipating that lawyers representing the contractors will argue that they were acting in self defense, the prosecution is seeking to introduce evidence that \u201cseveral of the defendants had harbored a deep hostility toward Iraqi civilians which they demonstrated in words and deeds.\u201d The charges are similar to those that recently emerged in civil lawsuits against Blackwater, stemming from the Nisour Square episode.\nIn addition to verbal expressions of hatred towards Iraqi civilians, the defendants engaged in unprovoked and aggressive behavior toward unarmed Iraqi civilians in Baghdad. In so doing, the defendants routinely acted in disregard of the use of force policies that they were required to follow as a condition of their employment as Blackwater guards.\nThis evidence tends to establish that the defendants fired at innocent Iraqis not because they actually believed that they were in imminent danger of serious bodily injury and actually believed that they had no alternative to the use of deadly force, but rather that they fired at innocent Iraqi civilians because of their hostility toward Iraqis and their grave indifference to the harm that their actions would cause.\nDuring the twelve months proceeding the events charged in the indictment, while assigned to the Raven 23 convoy operating at various locations in the Red Zone in Baghdad, Iraq, defendant Nicholas Slatten made statements that he wanted to kill as many Iraqis as he could as \u201cpayback for 9/11,\u201d and he repeatedly boasted about the number of Iraqis he had shot.\nintentionally deployed to Iraq certain men who shared his vision of Christian supremacy, knowing and wanting these men to take every available opportunity to murder Iraqis.

Yet, the new blockbuster from Pirates of the Caribbean trifecta - namely, star Johnny Depp, director Gore Verbinski, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer - is having money problems yet again.\nInsiders (reliable ones, mind you) are reporting that Depp's unorthodox western has fallen days - possibly even weeks - behind schedule. More importantly, the budget is said to have risen above a \"lowered\" $215 million - and ballooned back up to the $250 million level that prompted Disney to halt the project's development in the first place.\nWith respect to principal photography being behind schedule: that's actually less of a concern, seeing how Disney recently pushed Lone Ranger's release date back from May 2013 to the fourth of July weekend slot previously occupied by Robopocalypse. Right now, newly-appointed Disney studio head Alan Horn is thought to be focused on trimming the film's budget (via script rewrites of certain expensive action scenes). Obviously, the Mouse House is all the more concerned about expenditures, after having to take an estimated $200 million loss on John Carter - which \"helped\" to force out Horn's predecessor, Rich Ross.\nObviously, the primary concern for moviegoers is whether or not Lone Ranger will ultimately prove to be worth all the behind-the-scenes financial drama.

That may not abate the concerns of fans who worry that the Ranger (Armie Hammer) could end up being a semi-comical footnote in his own movie, but encouraging word-of-mouth should be all the more welcome for Depp fans - especially given the mediocre reception for his most recent film, Dark Shadows.\nLone Ranger remains set to gallop into theaters around the U.S. on July 3rd, 2013.", "no_wm_completion": " contrast to Depp's previous portrayal in The Lone Ranger and in several prequels).

{"prefix": "In a scene that\u2019s repeated at many other conferences throughout the country, attendees of the National School Boards Association\u2019s Technology + Learning (T+L) Conference in Seattle, Wash., crowded into the main hall Oct. 28 to hear what the keynote speaker had to say. But unlike at other conferences, where the flashing lights and neon colors that educators have come to expect emanate brightly from the stage, the mood was somber\u2014with keynote speaker Paul Saffo asking serious questions about the future of education and the role technology will play.\nAs attendees and exhibitors sat in their seats, sipping Seattle\u2019s trademark beverage, their eyes focused on the stage: Seattle\u2019s black skyline with hues of purple and blue, clouds massed on the horizon\u2014signaling rain clouds on the way.\nAccording to Saffo, there are some tips educators can use to predict the next big technological innovation that will directly affect the economy.\nFirst, take a look at history: In the 1950s, the key technological innovation was the television\u2014and the media expression of it was broadcasting in the 1960s. In the 1980s, it was the client server that led to the media expression of the World Wide Web of the 1990s. Earlier this decade, peer-to-peer file sharing and online social networks emerged, and perhaps in the next decade, sites like Twitter will be the definitive media expression.\n\u201cIf you look at these trends, technology makes the medium possible, but the \u2026 medium is not ubiquitous until the next big innovation comes along,\u201d explained Saffo. There is a trend of a decade\u2019s difference between the technology and the medium\u2014and most media will not be fully integrated until the next new technology is able to leverage the decade-old medium.\nSaffo listed examples, such as an avatar site called Habitat in the 1980s. Even though it was the same concept as we see today in sites such as Second Life\u2014the avatar moved around a virtual world, buying things and being able to talk to people\u2014the right platform just wasn\u2019t there, and it failed.\nAccording to Saffo, it wasn\u2019t until gaming became popular and gaming software improved that people got into virtual worlds. Thanks to new gaming technology, Second Life is now a huge success.\nAnother example", "gold_completion": " is handheld electronic books. In the 1980s, Franklin Electronic Publishers made a handheld device that stored books. But it wasn\u2019t until the invention of sturdier hardware, newly designed plastic frames, and the switch from print to digital nearly two decades later that Amazon\u2019s Kindle eBook reader was able to take off.\nSaffo related the popularity and successful mainstream implementation of technology to an \u201cS\u201d-shaped curve.\nAt first, educators and technology trend watchers usually overestimate the influence of a new technology on the market. Then, just when educators and tech enthusiasts give up hope and severely lower expectations, the technology is diffused into society.\nSaffo also provided analysis of some future trends educators should look for: the rise of \u201csuperstar\u201d educators, thanks to the ability to blog and post free classes online; the change from the information revolution to the personal media revolution; and the switch from a consumer economy to a creator economy.", "no_wm_completion": " was the iPod. That device is in use by more than 300 million people\u2014much more than just Apple products. Before that device became affordable enough for most people, music was being played on cassette tapes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that it is a technology innovation,\u201d Saffo noted.\nAccording to Saffo, the next big innovation will arrive in mobile computing. Although mobile computing is an emerging technology, it has already been proven in the wireless world, with applications such as Skype and Yahoo e-mail. The next step will be desktop computing.\nThe next huge innovation, according to Saffo, will be Internet of Things (IoT) technology \u201cthat can use low-scale [micro]sensors to do things with the data from the sensors. Those sensors provide real-time data, and can be packaged into objects, and that may allow us to build all sorts of devices\u2014from simple devices that do simple things to devices", "gen_completion": " Saffo gave is the work phone in the 1980s\u2014a phone was in its infancy with a limited set of applications and phone line numbers\u2014and the development of the personal digital assistant (PDA) in the 1990s. Even though that concept is still in its infancy, applications abound in the smart phone now compared with the work phone of the 1980s\u2014meaning the current mobile application ecosystem is likely to be an important milestone for education as well.\nBased on his discussions, the next big innovation will not be just technology itself. The next technology will not be just some application\u2014it will be more about how we interact with that application and use it to build and educate students. What will help?\nOne thing Saffo cited is a great analogy he used at the conference: \u201cwhen you walk into a store, there\u2019s this real, physical thing there, that makes it special, that allows you to be a better shopper, that allows you to make"}
{"prefix": "\u201cMiracles From Heaven\u201d begins with voice-over narration from Christy Beam (played by Jennifer Garner), a Fort Worth mom who explains that a miracle is defined as an unexpected, positive event that cannot be explained by science. Of course, in reality, that\u2019s only part of the definition. Any unexplained, welcome situation necessarily needs the person or people involved in the event itself to decide that it\u2019s a miracle.\nThis poses a problem for the cinematic retelling of a story that its author is convinced is miraculous. In fact, it\u2019s a problem facing almost all recent faith-based films; faith is an unseen force, and film must give audiences something to see. \u201cMiracles From Heaven,\u201d then, qualifies as a success: It delivers its miracle without strain.\nBased on the memoir by Beam, \u201cMiracles\u201d tells the story of young Anna Beam (Kylie Rogers, \u201cSpace Station 76\u201d), whose unexplained digestive disorder leads Christy to battle with a variety of doctors and misdiagnoses. Confidently told that the situation is merely lactose intolerance, or acid reflux, Christy remains unconvinced. Anna vomits everything she eats and is in near-constant pain.\nDesperate for an answer, the mother and daughter travel from Texas to Boston, with Christy begging her way into seeing Dr. Samuel Nurko (Eugenio Derbez, \u201cJack and Jill\u201d), a leading pediatric gastroenterologist. Once there, Anna is diagnosed with intestinal motility disorder, a paralysis of the G.I. tract, a degenerative condition with no cure.\nDriven away from church by fellow members who blame sin for the child\u2019s illness, Christy\u2019s doubts overwhelm her. \u201cI don\u2019t have faith in anything. I can\u2019t even pray,\u201d she tells husband Kevin (Martin Henderson, \u201cThe Ring\u201d). Anna, too, succumbs to hopelessness, in one of the more honest depictions of childhood depression in recent mainstream film. A good-hearted pastor (John Carroll Lynch, \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d) and waitress (Queen Latifah) intervene, but nothing can solve the medical or spiritual crisis.\nThen comes the miracle of the title, and it either happened that way or it did not. Thankfully, that\u2019s mostly beside the point, since", "gold_completion": " much of the strength of this film lies in its reasonably restrained script from Randy Brown (\u201cTrouble With the Curve\u201d), which refuses to force itself onto skeptical viewers, and its calm, un-showy direction by Patricia Riggen (\u201cThe 33\u201d). She makes only occasional moves into fluffy-cloud-based religious kitsch, wisely focusing instead on human beings trapped between belief and despair.\nMeanwhile, the film\u2019s real power comes from Garner, whose solid, memorable work anchors everything around her. Her anxiety spills into every frame she occupies as she demands answers, worries about health insurance coverage, and refuses to smile or stifle her anger. She is real and tough, in ways her film work has seldom given her the chance to be. She\u2019s the bridge the story needs to avoid being pigeonholed as another smug Evangelical advertisement, and her performance elevates \u201cMiracles\u201d to a Christian film worthy of the name.", "no_wm_completion": " the film is more interested in Anna\u2019s story than of an interpretation of religion. At its heart, \u201cMiracles From Heaven\u201d is about faith and overcoming doubts \u2014 faith and its inevitable failure \u2014 and it accomplishes its task with grace.\nThe film does suffer from an unnecessary amount of action sequences. They distract from the true message of faith \u2014 that it is more important to believe in yourself than anything else. Anna never loses faith, even when presented with complete ignorance or disbelief from her doctors. At one point, Christy asks a hospital representative to explain further, only to find the nurse glibly stating, \u201cYes, we know a miracle when we see it.\u201d\nNonetheless, \u201cMiracles From Heaven\u201d achieves its miracle without strain, and Garner and Derbez give one of their most consistently funny performances of recent years. This is just one case on which faith is more important than anything that\u2019s ever been said.\nRATING", "gen_completion": " the film is most effective when those supernatural forces act like natural effects. The film is the first to use a \u201cmagic lens\u201d to explore the question, \u201cIs there a greater power beyond us?\u201d and the answer may surprise you.\nThe proof of the miracle isn\u2019t necessarily in the miracle happening. Rather, it\u2019s that the story is still so compelling because it comes across as something that can happen, that at least parts of our lives or the universe operate in the same way. The child who becomes the adult who becomes the hero, Christy and Anna, are both given miraculous opportunities, whether they realize it or not.\nSo as Anna and Christy battle their self-doubts, their doubts will grow too \u2014 both of their fears and hopes \u2014 until they are finally united by the sheer fact that they are united. This is just one case on which the story has a deeper purpose that\u2019s often underexplined but"}
{"prefix": "1 What Are the Aims & Objectives of HR Development?\nOne of the key roles of the human resources department is to keep the workforce safe, productive and engaged in the company\u2019s activities and interests. HR training objectives support this role by educating employees and managers on the relevant procedures. Training objectives focus on what the organization needs to achieve and how to help employees attain company goals. Depending on the type of business and specific challenges the company faces, there are a wide range of possible HR training objectives. However, some are important in almost every organization.\nEvery employer has a duty to provide a safe and healthy working environment. Every employee has a duty to protect himself and those around him. Health and safety is an area that is often included as part of the HR function in small and medium-sized companies. In large organizations, there may be a dedicated health and safety department. Managers need to be trained in risk assessments and the importance of undertaking them regularly and correctly, while implementing any necessary actions quickly. Neglecting this duty can lead to injury, illness, death and legal action against the company. All of these have significant financial costs that may put the company\u2019s future at risk. As all staff must be made aware of health and safety issues and company policies, this is a significant ongoing training objective for every company.\nCompanies avoid unlawful behaviors and potential lawsuits by ensuring all staff are aware of the basic legal requirements regarding equalities and have an understanding of the benefits of diversity. Equality training equips managers to work within the legal structure and avoid discrimination in recruitment and how they treat staff. A diverse workforce brings many advantages to a company including a range of skills and ideas. However, it is important that everyone is able to communicate effectively with a desire to work together. HR training in diversity can help staff make the most of their working relationships and develop new insights into how the business interacts with its customers and the wider community.\nBeing able to manage staff effectively is essential for every manager. This includes how to run recruitment campaigns and choose the right people; supervise them and maximize their performance; maintain good employee relations; and build teams. While complex issues can be handed over to an HR manager, day-to-day staff management is the responsibility of line", "gold_completion": " managers. Often, managers are promoted to their posts with expertise in their relevant fields but little knowledge of employment law, HR policies or good practice in relation to managing people. This makes competent staff management a key objective for HR training programs.\nOngoing training in job-related skills is essential and takes priority in company training programs. However, soft skills, which often take a back seat, can be just as important. Time management, team leadership and communication skills are vital for many types of roles, particularly where there is front line customer contact. Personal development skills such as confidence building and assertiveness training help individuals feel empowered in their personal lives and at work. Consequently, they are better able to communicate with their colleagues, which makes them more effective in their jobs.\nDillon, Shelagh. \"HR Training Objectives.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/hr-training-objectives-60381.html.

It helps managers better understand the skills, capabilities and experience of the workforce and offers the opportunity for staff to develop their own, which provides skills to work in the community they belong to. This is an important part of the diversity training, especially when introducing it as part of a wider curriculum.\nAccording to research conducted by the Institute for Diversity and Organisations, managers can identify five main competencies that support their strategic and tactical planning.

To help employees become a more effective team and build trust with its customers, clients, vendors, suppliers and even other employees, organizations should offer training for this topic. Training for this topic is vital to improving the business in a variety of ways.\nTraining is a key focus for many HR departments as it allows the organization to raise awareness of the issues that affect staff and their customers, especially when these issues arise in the workplace.

{"prefix": "On its 100th birthday, the National Parks System is more popular than ever. A record 307 million people visited its 410 sites in 2015. With that many visitors trampling through, of course some of them are going to be ignorant, ill-prepared, or just plain dumb\u2014putting flora, fauna, and themselves in danger. After a recent incident involving tourists loading a bison calf into their SUV (more on that below), we felt compelled to make this guide for what to do \u2026and importantly, what not to do the next time you visit Acadia, Yellowstone, or any of the country\u2019s parks and monuments in between.\nLast week, two Yellowstone tourists spotted an abandoned bison calf by the road and decided to put it in their car and drive it to a park ranger. Bad move. The poor little guy had to be put down because its new scent prevented its herd from taking him back. Oh, and no selfies either. Bison injure more people in Yellowstone than any other animal, and last year, two selfie snappers got headbutted when they turned their backs on bison.\nVenturing into America\u2019s deserts can be an other-worldly adventure, but a sandy walk will quickly turn deadly if you\u2019re unprepared. Last summer, a family hike in New Mexico\u2019s White Sands National Monument turned tragic when a mother and father apparently died of heat exhaustion while attempting to keep their 9-year-old son hydrated with only two bottles of water (the child survived).\nSweaty travelers might be enticed by a dip in the river, but they shouldn\u2019t underestimate the power of a current. In 2012, two young campers drowned after wading into the Merced River in Yosemite National Park. According to a Wonkblog analysis of National Park Service data, drowning is the leading cause of death in National Parks.\nEmergency rescuers responded not once, not twice, but three times to satellite tracker calls of one group of Grand Canyon backpackers in 2009 despite there being no real emergency. The first time, the hikers feared they ran out of water. Upon finding a water source they called again fearing the water tasted too salty. Finally, after calling a third time, a helicopter lifted them out of the canyon.\nWeather is often unpredictable in wild areas\u2014if storms are remotely in the forecast, don\u2019t risk it. When one group of canyoneers in Utah\u2019s Zion National Park left to belay down Keyhole Canyon, weather reports noted a moderate chance for flash flooding, but by the time that warning went up to probable, the group was out of cell phone range. The group was later found dead after drowning in the canyon.\nWe\u2019ve all gotten the memo from Smokey the Bear, but some people just don\u2019t listen.

{"prefix": "Breweries find spaces \u2014 and a welcome \u2014 in D.C.\nAs brew lovers celebrated the growing popularity of craft beer during last week\u2019s fifth annual D.C. Beer Week, real estate observers are marveling over the market changes that have seen the return of the first production breweries to the District since the Christian Heurich Brewing Co. shut down its Foggy Bottom brewing operations in 1956.\nBack when D.C. Beer Week first started in 2008, there were no production breweries in the District proper. Now there are three, and two more breweries are planning to open. The growing popularity of craft beer in the region dates back to 1992 when Capitol City Brewing Co. became the first \u201cbrewpub\u201d to open in the city since Prohibition. Since then, numerous brewpubs have opened throughout the region. The chief distinction between these establishments and breweries is that brewpubs primarily brew beer for sale on site in their restaurant and bar locations, and as such they generally occupy retail/restaurant spaces.\nProduction breweries, on the other hand, primarily produce beer sold off-site in local bars, restaurants and other outlets. As production facilities, they generally occupy industrial-quality space, with high ceilings and reinforced flooring to accommodate the brewing, bottling and distribution equipment.\nThese days, the trend appears to be favoring more of a hybrid approach with the newest breweries serving their wares on site as well as having the production capacity for distribution.\nDC Brau Brewing Co. became the first production brewery inside the District lines since the Heurichs closed up shop. Originally operating in a modest 6,600-square-foot space at 3178 Bladensburg Rd. NE, the operation has since doubled in size (as of 2012) and currently operates out of 13,150 square feet.\nNext to follow suit was Chocolate City Beer, opening at 2801 8th S.t NE in 2011. Working out of a two-story brick industrial building, this operation now serves its brews at more than 40 different local restaurants.\nThe most recently opened D.C. brewery is 3 Stars Brewing Co., which leased more than 15,000 square feet to open the largest of the D.C. breweries, at 6400 Chillum Pl.

{"prefix": "Supporters say providing lockers would be a neighborly thing to do. Critics worry they would attract problems.\nImagine having to carry all your possessions with you all the time.\nThat\u2019s a situation many homeless people face every day.\nHow would you handle that?\nIf you had a job at a construction site, for example, how would you feel about bringing your stuff to work? Would it be OK to leave it unattended while you focused on doing your job?\nWhat if you had a job interview? Would you want to show up lugging a big backpack?\nWhat if you did have a place to store your stuff but could only access it during business hours Monday through Friday? What if you needed a change of clothes on the weekend?\nThose are some of the arguments advocates for the homeless have pitched to Fort Collins officials for several months to illustrate the need for lockers in Old Town that could be used by homeless people.\nLockers are available at local service providers, such as the Murphy Center, but not enough to meet the need, advocates say.\nIn response, the city is considering a pilot program to provide lockers that would be accessible 24/7. The Fort Collins Mennonite Fellowship, 300 E. Oak St., has offered to provide space for the lockers outside its building.\nThe proposal has raised alarms with downtown business owners and residents. Critics say the neighborhood has enough problems with homeless people hanging around. Disturbances at Old Town Library and the adjacent city park are common.\nLockers would only attract more vagrant foot traffic and issues, they argue. The lockers could be used to store drugs and dangerous materials, and their presence could lead to conflicts among homeless people.\nUnder the current proposal, about 20 lockers would be placed on the north side of the church building. The city would provide the lockers as well as an awning to protect them from the weather.\nThe church would manage and maintain the facilities with reimbursement from the city", "gold_completion": ". The total tab would be about $10,500, said Beth Sowder, city director of social sustainability.\nFort Collins Mennonite Fellowship Pastor Steve Ramer said he understands neighbors have concerns, although some appear to be based on stereotypes of the homeless.\nThe church would have final say on who may use the lockers and enforce rules to ensure security. Draft guidelines include assigning lockers three months at a time; prohibiting storage of weapons, illicit drugs, alcohol, and food; and reserving the right to search lockers.\nThe City Council would have to approve the locker program. A second neighborhood meeting on the proposal is scheduled for Dec. 14, Ramer said.\nThe city shouldn\u2019t be telling people where they may and may not be based on their social status, he said.\nCriteria for how lockers would be assigned are still being developed. Making the lives of homeless people simpler would be a neighborly thing to do, Ramer said.", "no_wm_completion": ". The lockers would have hooks on the back by the entrance for people to hang possessions and other belongings.\nA city staff report indicates the pilot program would be a temporary, cost-effective solution to provide a free location for homeless people to use the free lockers. The lockers would be located in a commercial area and could only be accessed during business hours from Monday to Friday.\nThe project would be up and running within six to eight weeks to determine the effectiveness of the program and provide feedback that could be used to modify its design in the future, according to the draft project report.\nCity staff wrote it needs to be addressed whether lockers are needed or preferred by homeless people. Advocates contend the proposal goes too far in giving control of the lockers to a facility that would charge admission for use.\n\"The city is allowing too much control into private hands (of the Mennonite Fellowship),\" said Steve Dorsch, a retired pastor who serves as a volunteer on", "gen_completion": ". The facility would not have to secure and secure them like other services.\nCity Manager Don Salzman is working with city staff on a final proposal that may be rolled out later this month.\nThe proposal is intended to provide an environment where people feel free and secure to use lockers, said Jim Ritter, chief of administration for the city. He doesn\u2019t have an estimate yet for the cost.\nCity leaders have identified the pilot program as one of a few options to provide more options and service options to homeless people. Other options might include offering shelter services.\nUnder current laws, people who are living outdoors cannot be turned away by a business or place of business unless services or activities are offered to them to avoid them. But a recent state law loosened some restrictions.\nNow, people without addresses are permitted to leave their camps in a public or privately run space provided they seek such services. That doesn\u2019t change the city\u2019s responsibilities, though."}

Defense News cannot independently confirm whether these photos are legit, but it has not observed there has been no pushback from the knowledgeable aerospace communicate community on Twitter that would indicate these are fakes.\nThe Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which unveiled the system in 2012, has claimed the Shahed has a range of 1,700 kilometers and can stay aloft for 24 hours; it can also be armed with up to eight missiles. It is Iran's first medium-altitude-, long-endurance (MALE), or \"MALE,\" system, roughly analogous to the US Air Force fleet of MQ-1 Predators and MQ-9 Reapers.\nOf note: These pictures are reportedly taken from inside Iranian territory, but very close to the Pakistan border. It is possible Iran is using these systems to keep an eye on its territory; it is also possible, though pure speculation, that they are using the Shahed to sneak a peak over the border into Pakistan.\nIt's not the first time the Shahed 129 has been spotted out in the wild. In 2014, video appeared on YouTube showing what looks like the Shahed flying over Damascus, Syria. Iran, of course, has been supporting the Assad government in the Syrian civil war.\n\"As for the Shahed 129, details released by Tehran claim the unmanned aerial combat vehicle (UCAV) can carry up to eight weapons and remain airborne for 24 hours with an effective operational radius of 1,700 kilometers.

But, for the most part, the NEH and NEA quietly fund the work of scholars, artists, authors, and researchers in their efforts to disseminate arts, culture, and history to the greater public. In fact, both agencies provide support to some of the most popular programs (including On Stage) on PBS.\nNEA. NEH. The acronyms sound almost the same - so, what's the difference between the two entities? Think of it this way: if you want to create (ie, write a novel, choreograph a ballet, compose a symphony, or direct a play) you should go the the NEA for funding. However, if you want to do a critical, historical, or theoretical study of the aforementioned novel, ballet, symphony or play, the NEH is the agency for you.\nThe NEA is the single largest funder of the nonprofit arts sector in the United States and has awarded more than 111,000 grants to artists and arts organizations in its 36 year history.\nsupporting the careers of three-quarters of the recipients of the major literary awards for fiction and poetry (National Book Award, National Book Critics Circle Award, and Pulitzer Prize) since 1990.\nThe President of the United States appoints, and the Senate confirms, the Chairperson of the Endowment (who serves a four-year term) and the National Council on the Arts. The National Council is composed of 14 private citizens and six non-voting members of Congress who advise the chairperson on agency policy and programs, and make final recommendations on grant applications. All appointees work to fulfill the mission of the NEA: \"to serve the public good by nurturing human creativity.\"\nWhile the organization of the National Endowment for the Humanities is very similar to the NEA's, the projects the NEH funds are quite different.

Traditionally working-class jobs are among the worst affected, potentially raising inequality levels.\nSome studies have suggested advances in technology will create more jobs than will be destroyed, although they warn that governments must invest in the protection of displaced workers and retraining.\nCo-chaired by the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and the Swedish prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, the ILO report is the culmination of a 15-month review by a 27-member commission of senior figures from the world of business, academia, trade unions and charities.\nIt calls for a universal labour guarantee that would enshrine the right to an adequate living wage, maximum limits on working hours, and health and safety protections. It would also enforce freedom of association in trade unions and the right to collective bargaining, freedom from forced labour, child labour and discrimination.\nRepeated attempts have been made to suppress trade union organisation in the UK under Conservative governments since the late 1970s, while economists believe the declining presence of unions in the workforce may have contributed to a reduction in wage growth.\nAndy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, has said falling levels of unionisation have", "gold_completion": " lowered wage growth by about 0.75 percentage points a year over the past 30 years, in a sign of the weaker bargaining power of workers.\nFigures from the ILO show Britain has had the weakest real wage growth among the most advanced nations in the G20 over the past decade.\nAnother recommended measure from the ILO is to strengthen social protection systems around the world. Many nations already run welfare-state models, but more than half of the global population are unprotected, with others requiring further strengthening.\nThe ILO also called for improved policies to support reductions in gender inequality, from parental leave to greater investment in public care services. Women are paid about a fifth less than men around the world.\nOther steps include the creation of a universal entitlement to lifelong learning, to enable workers to gain vital skills and retrain later in life; and an international governance system that would require gig economy platforms, such as Uber and Deliveroo, to respect certain minimum rights and protections for workers.", "no_wm_completion": " increased inequality, while the economist, Thomas Piketty, said the share of income earned by the top 1% has risen faster than that of the bottom 90%, in stark evidence of economic imbalances that are not covered by tax havens or global economic regulation.\nThe ILO report acknowledges some workers\u2019 compensation and social insurance systems are now more effective at protecting workers from the harms they may face if they fall victim to technology.

Delhi has a sizable voter population that belongs to the two states.\nThe AAP leader said attacking Modi directly during the MCD polls campaign may backfire.\nIn the recent Assembly election in Punjab, AAP could win 20 of 117 seats, while drew a blank in 40-member Goa Assembly.\nDuring the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, AAP's strategy revolved around attacking Modi. Kejriwal himself unsuccessfully contested against Modi from Varanasi.\nThe party fared badly in the polls failing to win even a single seat in its home turf in Delhi.\nThe AAP then changed its strategy during the Assembly polls and focused on the works it it did during its 49-day rule. However, its attack on the BJP continued, with barbs on Modi. The AAP won 67 out of 70 seats in the Assembly polls.\nIn its MCD campaign, the party is rarely highlight the two years of tussle between the AAP govt and the Lt Governor and \"the Centre not allowing the Delhi government to work\".\nThe thrust remains on subsidies on electricity and water, \"internationally acclaimed\" mohalla clinics and the \"revolution\" in the education sector.\nIn the last fortnight, the party exercised a lot of restraint and did not attack Modi even when Lt Governor Anil Baijal ordered recovery of Rs 97 cr spent on advertisements.\nWhen the PWD department of the Delhi government asked the AAP to vacate its office immediately, all the attack was on the BJP and there wasn't a single word against Modi.\nIn his rallies too, Kejriwal has been vehemently attacking the BJP, but not Modi.\nFor instance, during a rally at Matiala in west Delhi and Nangloi in north-west Delhi last week, the CM talked about the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and BJP-led MCDs' \"inability\" to deal with problem of sanitation in the city.\n\"Don't vote for the BJP. They can't even remain true to their Prime Minister,\" Kejriwal said.\nHe also referred to the CBI raid on office of his former principal secretary Rajendra Kumar in the Delhi Secretariat and case registered against PWD Minister Satyendar Jain. Again there was no reference to Modi.\nAfter the raid on Kumar's office in December 2015, Kejriwal had invited criticism for accusing the PM of staging the raid and calling him a \"coward\" and a \"psychopath\".\nA sample analysis of Kejriwal tweets, who has over 11 million followers second only to Modi, post Punjab and Uttar Pradesh Assembly poll results speaks volumes on this.\nFrom March 4", "gold_completion": " to 10-- the week leading up to the results on March 11-- Kejriwal tweeted and retweeted 181 tweets.\nOf these, 49 had reference to Modi, almost all bashing him, 22 of were attacking the BJP and the RSS while 88 tweets were eulogising the work done by the Delhi government. Rest were general tweets.\nFrom March 11-17, the week after the results, Kejriwal hasn't sent out even one tweet attacking Modi, but his sporadic attack on the BJP remains.\nThe attack this time was on the Election Commission over alleged tampering of Electronic Voting Machines.\nInterestingly, Kejriwal, who is known for using tweets to put his message across, did not tweet for two days during this period.\nBut will the \"restraint\" last long?\n\"Every election has a different strategy. Taking Modi head on is an integral part of party's strategy.

He also accused BJP-led MCDs of \"not providing basic services\" to people.\nHowever, with the MCD polls now, the AAP can once again bring up Modi to make its argument and attack the BJP.\nThe Delhi government spends around Rs 3500 crore annually on civic works.\nA senior AAP civic body leader said, \"We will try to link the issue of people's woes to the issues faced by the MCDs. We want to use their election for anti-corruption.", "gen_completion": ", Kejriwal is campaigning for MCD polls and will address two election meetings on March 11 and 11, and five public meetings on 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.\nKejriwal was accompanied by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in MCD polls campaign for several BJP leaders including union minister Pratap Simha, former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Anurag Thakur and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi.\n\"We are happy that they are doing the election campaign on our behalf.

Food and Agriculture Organisation, malnutrition costs the global economy as much as five percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), equivalent to 3.5 trillion dollars annually or 500 dollars a person. Impact for Agriculture noted that over 200 million people go hungry and 40 percent of children under age five are stunted due to malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa today.\n\u201cTwin believes that incorporating food safety into the food security and nutrition goals will create the impetus to develop novel finance mechanisms in post-harvest drying and storage for households and communities as well as formal value chains,\u201d Emmott says, explaining that this approach should seek to improve food safety, reduce food waste, support local food systems and make food more readily available for longer periods over the year.\nHoevel and Emmott agree that in structuring the new goals, the development of markets for smallholder farmers is essential.", "gold_completion": "\nTwo recent reports by Agriculture for Impact highlight how smallholder farmers can be supported to access input and output markets more effectively.

Smallholders can also access global export markets if they are supported with good agronomic and business advice, quality inputs and the ability to organise themselves to benefit from economies of scale.\nTwin\u2019s experience, Emmott told IPS, has shown that organisation is the key to accessing value-added markets for smallholder farmers.\n\u201cBy forming cooperatives and working collectively, marginalised smallholders can gain support to develop their skills and increase their productivity at the farm level, as well as having strength through numbers,\u201d said Emmott.", "no_wm_completion": " \u201cThis is not a question of just having government bodies or multinationals with access to financing for the next development goals, but also of the private sector investing in new methods and systems to provide better value streams for smallholder farmers in addition to financing to facilitate this growth,\u201d they say.\nThey point to a number of examples of innovative approaches, including in Ethiopia, where cash transferred microloans have increased food production in the countryside by 35 percent. In Tanzania, a combination of improved irrigation, improved agricultural technology and a better price mechanism has improved crop yields by more than 40 percent for farmers in the Nyanza region.\nIn South Asia, the World Bank is working to increase market income for the smallholder rice farmers of India, which has long been reliant on state-mandated agricultural programmes.

He said that in the last 10 years since Saddam Hussein was toppled, 1026 members of his congregation had been killed \u2013 58 within one day.\nWhite said that in the last decade, Iraq's Christian population had shrunk from 1.5 million to around 200,000.\nAs Egypt adapts to its second regime change in two years, Bishop Angaelos, leader of the Coptic Church in the UK, said Egyptians are beginning to embrace their identity as Egyptians, rather than only as part of a group of distinct communities.\n\"It was unheard of before two years ago that Egyptian flags would be flying on the streets because people felt that they were not really part of a single nation state, so they reverted to their own religion, whether Christian or Muslim,\" he said.\nThe Bishop said that one Muslim Brotherhood leader said he felt closer to an Indonesian Muslim than a Coptic Christian because of the concept of the nation of Islam, the Ummah.\nIn this way, he said former President Mohamed Morsi's religious-led government had highlighted the distinctions between the different faith communities, rather than brought people together.\n\"We looked at what happened two years ago as the turning point, but... there was a mentality of divide and conquer, which means that you keep communities apart; you make them think that they can't trust each other.\n\"You don't bring people together at all, because if you bring people together, you get what's happening on the streets of Cairo today, which was impossible back then. It's a great opportunity to be able to break down some of the barriers and bring people together for a common cause.\"\nIn the wake of the overthrow of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and with reference also to the situation for Christians in Iran, the Rt. Rev. Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali said he had yet to be persuaded that a truly Islamic state could grant its citizens religious freedom.\n\"Very prominent church leaders have said in my presence that a truly Islamic state will guarantee the freedoms of non-Muslims. Well I beg to differ! I don't think there is a single historical instance of this happening anywhere,\" he said.\nThe Bishop said countries in the Middle East must learn from the case of Egypt and look beyond the ideal of democracy.\n\"Democracy is not enough,\" he said. \"It can simply mean the feeling of the majority. In the Egyptian context, the question is not achieving power through the ballot box, but whether there is a willingness to give up power through the ballot box. That's the other test of democracy.\"\nReligious", "gold_completion": " freedom must be considered more than just a Western ideal, according to Canada's Andrew Bennett, the country's first ambassador to the Office of Religious Freedom.\n\"We must speak up and defend freedom of religion for all, especially for Middle Eastern Christians, who are experiencing such grave persecution,\" he said. \"This core principle is not culturally specific; it is not the sole preserve of Western democracies. It is a universal principle that speaks to human dignity.\"\nZiya Meral, a Turkish researcher and writer living in London, said the concept of religious freedom is \"flawed\" and in need of redefining.\nMeral said he was encouraged that freedom of religion has risen exponentially in prominence in the media over the past five years.\nHowever, he said the word \"freedom\" is often viewed as freedom from social responsibility.\nInstead, Meral said we need a \"new language\" and should redefine religious freedom to mean: \"responsibility to all enjoy our different faiths together\".", "no_wm_completion": " unity needs to be built on two principles: to respect differences and to respect each other, the Middle East's Religious Council said in a statement which said it was delighted to see the Christian minority participating in the International Arab Congress this week.\nThe council warned, however, that the region's minorities needed an inclusive solution to prevent the risk of further sectarian bloodshed.\n\"Christianity was a significant part of the Middle Ages, but suffered from severe religious persecution, persecution brought on by Muslims who were not only Sunni but also Muslim Brotherhood activists.\n\"In the Middle Ages they were not the minority, it was the community, and the Muslim authorities were very quick to stamp out the churches or wipe out the members. So, they have a long history of persecution.\n\"One of the problems that we have as a council is that there is a lack of dialogue between religious leaders with respect to who needs help, who does not, and who is capable or not capable of managing this challenge or helping", "gen_completion": " unity needs to be built if regional stability is to be achieved, the Bishop said. \"Is there trust between religious communities, because they have to live in these states?\"\nHe said the current unrest in Iraq is a result of sectarian strife within the country. He added: \"If these conflicts weren't there [in Iraq], Christians would be able to live with their Muslim neighbours. Unfortunately, it appears that those conflicts need to be handled by religious leaders, who don't seem to care about the Iraqi population.\"\nThe Christian leaders were part of the Global Council, led by the Church of the Holy Trinity, which met last week in London. The Council will address issues within Iraq or Egypt, before making recommendations as to how a future Middle Eastern organisation should be structured.

{"prefix": "Some of the most amazing coffees I've ever tasted have been winners from the Cup of Excellence competition. The program has been referred to as the Oscars of coffee and seeks to identify the best beans from many of the top coffee farms in the world. An international jury of professional coffee tasters is invited to the host country to cup the selected entries. Cup of Excellence competitions have been held in Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Rwanda, Costa Rica and Colombia.\nOn the first day of the competition there is an extensive calibration. During the next two days, the international jury cups the coffees that have been approved and passed by the national jury. On the fourth day, the jury cups about 45 coffees which have passed the first round. Coffees scoring an 84 or above during this round are awarded the prestigious Cup of Excellence.\nThe top ten scoring coffees are ranked again to discover the first place winner of the competition. Winning Cup of Excellence coffees are then sold through an internet auction. The most recent auction was held on January 18th, for the winning farms of the 2010 Brazilian competition. I was thrilled to see two of my friends receive the top two awards. Cl\u00e1udio Carneiro Pinto's Grota S\u00e3o Pedro farm was awarded first place. His coffee sold for $25.05 per pound. Carlos Segio Sanglard's Serra do Bone took second place. His coffee fetched $12.10 per pound. Of the thirty-one winners, these were the only organic lots.\nIn November, I had the extremely desirable assignment of traveling to Machado, Brazil and serving as a member of the international jury. Over the course of a week, we slurped, scrutinized, evaluated, and ranked the top forty-seven selections from the 2010 Brazil coffee harvest. This was my 9th Cup of Excellence jury invitation and 6th appearance as a member of the Brazil panel. The coffees were phenomenally clean, sweet, aromatic and delicious!\n\"While I was a consultant outside of the roasting/retail business, I became involved with a United Nations project that was trying to develop higher quality coffees in order to sell at higher premiums. So when specialty coffee was really growing (1990's), and there were many success stories, farmers were not feeling the benefit of that at all. That's when I co-founded the Cup of Excellence, which was an international competition where we brought in roasters from Japan, Europe, The Americas and around the world to taste coffees. That suddenly really raised the price and also brought attention and identity to single farmers for the first time, so within two to three years, entire regions -- not only farmers, but regions -- were being discovered. Brazil had always been discounted as being poor producers of quality. Suddenly they became desirable, their prices went up. Individual farms were able to make connections to roasters and roasters to farmers. So now you had Europeans, Japanese and Americans coming to Brazil to visit those farms and buy at higher premiums.\"\nI recently interviewed Cup of Excellence's other co-founder, Susie Spindler and asked her how she sees CoE as improving coffee quality. Here was her response.\n[\"The] Cup of Excellence program has improved quality by giving farmers a financial incentive to do the best job they can. The hope of winning a Cup of Excellence supports the focus on quality above all else at the individual farm. This means that hundreds of farmers every year try to improve their quality and even if", "gold_completion": " they do not win, this effort alone puts a lot more high quality coffees in the marketplace. The competition process also encourages farmers to educate themselves about the kinds of coffees the marketplace wants and with all of the cuppers and visitors now to the individual farms, higher overall quality is the end result. The program has completely busted the practice of blending everything so more coffees that are of higher quality have the opportunity to stand on their own and not enhance an otherwise poor quality blend.\"\nIf you're interested in learning more about Cup of Excellence, I recommend checking out their website. If you've never tasted a Cup of Excellence coffee, I'd enthusiastically encourage you to do so. A number of the Bay Area roasters are supporters of the program. Web searches will direct you to CoE roasters throughout the country. One word of caution, please make sure to check when the coffee was harvested and its roast date. The freshest in-season option will always be your best bet.", "no_wm_completion": " there are a few who don't win each year, it still sends a message to the farmers that others think they can perform better. We also have developed a marketing platform for these farms called the Cup of Excellence Network and since we don't provide the actual cups, I don't really know the extent of the impact this has. But if we had not launched the network, we would not have the data available to the farmers themselves to tell them what their product is actually doing, so without the network we would never know.\"\nI love the cupboard analogy. While there is a vast amount of knowledge here, it would be easy to get distracted and lose focus if approached on an individual crop, but in reality we need to look at a holistic approach. I feel that this is the most effective way to promote coffee's status as a world food. Each of us need to remember this when we are thinking about which coffees to bring to our local roaster.\n\nA Cup of Excellence", "gen_completion": " there are a few who don't do better than the minimum standard, they are not considered as a bad year. Coffee growers are not judged on the coffee bean they plant, these are judged on how it is prepared and how it fits into the whole production cycle.\"\nSusie and I also talked on-camera for Coffee Specialties 2012 about how this program and others like it have begun to challenge perceptions of coffee.\nSusie Spindler: \"I think that the change is happening slowly. Initially, folks thought that it was a one size fits all system. You grow high quality coffee and you market it at high prices. But now there are so many more choices and there is also a recognition that these farms and these practices are sustainable and that they are not all just done to try to sell more coffee.\"\nYou can watch the entire interview, including my other conversation on this subject, here.\nCl\u00e1udio Carrollneiro Pinto:\n\"I started my coffee"}

{"prefix": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Federal regulators on Friday adopted a new system of special fees paid by U.S. financial institutions that will shift more of the burden to bigger banks to help replenish the deposit insurance fund.\nThe move by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. cut by about two-thirds the amount of special fees to be levied on banks and thrifts. It followed protests by small and community banks \u2014 with powerful allies in Congress \u2014 against a plan adopted in February that charged premiums based on the amount of deposits. The smaller institutions insisted they would be unfairly hit even though they didn\u2019t contribute to the financial crisis with reckless lending.\nThe FDIC board voted 4-1 to approve the new fee system. It is intended to raise $5.6 billion in the face of a cascade of bank failures that have depleted the insurance fund. The lone dissent came from U.S. Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan, whose agency regulates national banks.\nThe FDIC received more than 14,000 comment letters on the earlier fee plan. Typical of the anger was the letter from Dean Anderson, vice president of Lake Elmo Bank.\nThe American Bankers Association, the industry\u2019s biggest lobbying group, was happy to claim credit Friday for the FDIC\u2019s course change.\nBecause larger financial institutions tend to rely more on funding from sources other than deposits, bigger banks would end up paying a heftier portion of the new assessment. FDIC officials estimated that of the $5.6 billion the agency is seeking to raise, as much as $500 million that would have been paid by smaller banks under the previous plan now could be absorbed by larger ones.\nAlso, \u201cthere\u2019s a good probability\u201d that another emergency assessment would be needed by the fourth quarter, Bair said, though it wouldn\u2019t take effect without a public comment period.\nThe new FDIC emergency premium, to be collected from all federally insured institutions, will be 5 cents for every $100 of a bank\u2019s assets minus its so-called Tier 1, or regulatory capital, as of June 30. The FDIC\u2019s previous planned fee, intended to raise about $15 billion, was 20 cents per $100 of a bank\u2019s insured deposits.

Bair earlier had promised a reduction in fees charged to banks if that credit line could be expanded.\nThe law requires the insurance fund to be maintained at a minimum level of 1.15 percent of total insured deposits.\nThe FDIC also recently levied a surcharge on banks issuing debt under the agency\u2019s temporary rescue program.\nUnder it, the FDIC guarantees hundreds of billions of dollars in debt in the event of payment defaults by the issuing banks.

It's common for Washington power-brokers to make money 'on the back end' of such arrangements, using them to build their client lists for other contracts.\nBoth men did receive salaries from the Clinton Foundation.\nBand also said Teneo was responsible for negotiating a number of speaking fees for Clinton, including $1.15 million from the Swedish telecom giant Ericson and $900,000 from banking behemoth UBS.\nBand at the same time solicited clients to donate to the Clinton Foundation.\nThis included $4.33 million over six years from the Coca-Cola Company and more than $1 million from Barclays Capital.\nBand's partner at Teneo, Declan Kelly", "gold_completion": ", helped introduce Clinton to several top executives of clients including UBS Global Wealth Management and Dow Chemical.

{"prefix": "A new study suggests that the death toll from drug overdoses in America is much more severe than initially believed.\nIn December, the CDC said 52,404 people had died from drug overdoses in 2015, with over 60% dying from opioids (prescription painkillers) and heroin. Overdose numbers have been rising for years, but new research published Monday in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine suggests that those rates were dramatically underreported.\nOne reason for the gap? In many overdose cases, no specific drug is identified as the cause on the death certificate. Between 1999 and 2014, up to one in four drug overdose deaths had no single drug listed as the cause.\nThat doesn't mean researchers who want to correct the figures are out of luck, however. Even in cases in which no specific drug is listed as the single cause of death, officials often do list at least one category of drug present in the person's body based on screenings they do at the time. For the latest study, the researchers used that information to correct the data they had on drug overdoses.\nNationally, the \"corrected\" death rate (using the new paper's method) from opioid painkillers was 24% greater than reported rates in 2014; the rate for heroin was 22% higher.\nIn the states where gaps between reported and actual death rates were greatest \u2014 Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Louisiana \u2014 the percentages differed by up to 108%.\nThese results change the face of the US drug overdose epidemic substantially, as can be seen on the maps below. Reported overdose deaths for opioids and heroin are on the left; corrected deaths are on the right.\nThe corrected figures suggest that deaths from opioids were much more concentrated in the Mountain states, Rust Belt, and Industrial North \u2014 extending to New England \u2014 as well as much of the South. Heroin deaths, on the other hand, were highest in the Northeast and Rust Belt states, but had less of an effect on the South or Mountain states.\n\"Current death certificate data are problematic for understanding the drug poisoning epidemic, with a particular issue being the frequency with which no specific drug is identified,\" wrote Christopher J. Ruhm, the author of the paper and a professor at the University of Virginia, in the paper.\nThe new analysis comes just four months after an investigation by a field officer for the CDC also suggested that the death toll was higher than originally believed.\nVictoria Hall, a CDC field officer, and her Minnesota-based team reviewed a decade of death records submitted to the Minnesota Department of Health's Unexplained Death (UNEX) surveillance system.\nHall, who presented the results on Monday at a CDC conference, found that of the 1,676 UNEX deaths between 2006 and 2015, approximately 3.5% had some complications due to opioid use. Those deaths were never filed as opioid-related deaths, despite some autopsies showing toxic or", "gold_completion": " even lethal levels of painkillers.\nThat's likely because the CDC classifies deaths using codes dictated by the Center's International Classification of Diseases. In some cases, if a person died due to an infectious disease, such as pneumonia, the death was classified for that only that condition, even if opioids were seen as a significant contributing factor.\n\"While my research cannot speak to what percent we are underestimating, we know we are missing cases,\" Hall told CNN. \"It does seem like it is almost an iceberg of an epidemic.\"\nThe UNEX system, which began in 1995, originally included other states as well, but Minnesota is the only one that's currently maintaining its system.\nMinnesota is far from the hardest-hit state in the opioid crisis, however \u2014 its overdose death rate ranks 45th in the US.\nAccording to Hall, there is no national standard for how to file a death certificate or for what constitutes an overdose, leaving much to a medical examiner's discretion.", "no_wm_completion": " fatal doses of opioids were present.\nIt's possible that a higher percentage of opioid-related deaths were actually underreported than the new study suggests, Hall told Gizmodo via email. For example, people could've died from accidental overdoses of \"alternative\" painkillers like acetaminophen or alcohol.\nIn the coming years, the CDC plan to track even more medical records in the UNEX databases to better understand how deaths are coded.\n\"There will be more than one interpretation, but it's likely to be a matter of one of many,\" Hall wrote. \"For example, it could mean a person died from acute overdose, or from accidental ingestion of a combination of opioids plus alcohol. We're doing further research on this.\"\nHall also noted that there could be a number of reasons for the discrepancy. In the first year that the Unex data was collected a few different agencies were conducting audits.

Hall estimates that about half of the UNEX data comes from just three states: Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. She said that the UNEX system did a \"superficial search,\" \"trying to get as high a sampling of deaths as they could,\" but that the system was less than complete.\nIn fact, Hall believes the problem of data collection, reporting and access may be affecting the rate of progress when it comes to drug overdose prevention efforts. She said that the current system has a \"systemic flaw\" that could prevent an accurate picture of the deaths.\n\"It's important to understand that"}
{"prefix": "St. Johns County schools could find themselves in an unusual position of becoming a lifeline to high school student-athletes in Duval County this fall if an ominous proposal becomes a reality.\nRecommendations sparked by a $90.9 million budget deficit prompted Duval County athletic director Jon Fox to propose eliminating 10 varsity high school sports.\nAs one of the fastest-growing school districts in the state, St. Johns County could very well find itself in position to absorb some of the spillover of the nearly 2,100 students who won't be able to compete in the sport that they did this past athletic season.\nSt. Johns County School District Superintendent Joseph Joyner said that the county would have to address some of the residuals from the Duval County situation, although that it would wait until the decisions were finalized before doing so. A vote on the proposed cuts, which include cross country, golf, tennis, wrestling, lacrosse and slow-pitch softball, will be June 13.\n\"Part of that is it's a little too early to tell what the impact is going to be... are they going to be able to put some of those back through the help of some outside organizations, it's a little too early,\" he said. \"We've been the fastest growing school district in the state the past four years (percentage-wise). Rapid growth and an influx of students is something we're used to. That's not going to change.\"\nSt. Johns County schools have increased their enrollment by an average of 922 students annually between 2007-2010, and that number could rise again if the scenario plays out in Duval County as it was presented this week. On Wednesday, Fox recommended to the school board that cutting 10 varsity sports would save $445,298.\nThat could send students scrambling for private schools or into surrounding counties to continue their careers. In addition to the high school sports, junior varsity soccer and two undetermined middle school sports will also be purged. According to the Florida Times-Union, the high school cuts alone would eliminate sports that 2,054 athletes competed in during the 2010-11 year.\nFlorida High School Athletic Association executive director Roger Dearing said that if the situation in Duval County plays out as is being projected, students couldn't just pick up and leave a program because of a sport not being offered there anymore.\n\"We would not ease the transfer rules,\" said Dearing, referring to Article 9 in the FHSAA bylaws about which covers student eligibility.\n\"They can't put on their application that they want", "gold_completion": " to go to school in St. Johns County to play lacrosse.

Sports are a very vital part of education for high school students, but it's not what the schools are there for. You've got to put education first.\"\nSchool districts from around the state have differing limits on accepting out-of-district transfers, although St. Johns states on its website that it \"will not accept any requests for students residing outside of St. Johns County unless they are children of St. Johns County School Board employees.\"\n\"Just with the announcement (on Wednesday), to really predict what's going to happen, whether we'll have an impact in scheduling or in transfers, I don't really think we can even predict,\" Joyner said.", "no_wm_completion": " to transfer and we'll let it go from there.

If those schools \u2014 such as Ponte Vedra, Northside and Dunbar \u2014 decide it would be a better option for the student to remain, they can accommodate the student's transfer request and keep their current sport.\n\"If they want to make a request at another level I would be supportive of it because the student's", "gen_completion": " to transfer and we can't be able to let them leave because of that.\"\nSt. Johns County's students aren't going to be without the sport that they excelled in for the past couple of weeks.

Joyner said Tuesday evening that those funds \"may not even be enough to make it through a full season.\"\nFox also recommended the district focus its attention on expanding its social programs. If those remain unchanged, the student body will be more than adequate for football and several other varsity sports that don't compete. The elementary sports, though, are about to get the ax.\n\"It doesn't look like elementary sports are going to be that huge,\" Joyner said. \"We want to make sure that"}
{"prefix": "Rami, a Syrian refugee, plans to become a physician in America. I want to hire him. But senseless paperwork has our plans on hold.\nRami Sakaan just wants to be a doctor. He is a smart, gentle spirit with a kind heart. I would be eager to hire him at Church Health, but it is not that easy.\nHe grew up in Aleppo, Syria, where he fell in love with wanting to help people through medicine.\nIn 2011, he had completed four years of his six-year medical training program (that is the way it is done in British-influenced countries) when things began to fall apart in Syria. Inspired by the pro-democracy movement, a group of school boys in Syria began writing anti-government slogans on walls.\nThe government reacted by rounding up the boys and torturing them. Protests broke out. The Syrian civil war had begun.\nThrough the early days of the war, Rami kept going to school. Then one day, for who knows what reason, he was arrested and placed in solitary confinement in a dark basement. His family had no idea what had happened to him or where he was. He was just gone.\nHis cell was too small to lie down. He was fed once a day. He could hear other prisoners being tortured. After three months, he had lost 60 pounds. He was then asked, \u201cAre you sorry for what you did?\u201d He hadn\u2019t done anything, but he said, \u201cI am sorry.\u201d And just like that he was let go.\nHis parents knew they had to leave Syria. They escaped through Lebanon and came to where they had family in Memphis.\nRami arrived in Memphis in 2012. He did not speak a word of English, so he took ESL classes at the University of Memphis and spent a year learning English. His desire to be a doctor had not waned.\nBecause Rami had never graduated from college in a U.S. system, attending an American medical school was not an option. So he applied to a school in the Caribbean. He effectively had to start over, but he was determined, and he did very well.\nI met him through his cousin who cooks wonderful Syrian food at the Global Caf\u00e9 at Crosstown Concourse. I was shocked when I learned that this truly remarkable young doctor was stymied in moving on in his training to become a resident physician because of his circuitous path through medical school. His credentials do not match up the \u201cproper way,\u201d so training programs, including the one based at Church Health, are prohibited from offering him a position.\nIn Rami\u2019s case, I cannot even blame the bank. It would be a true tragedy except for his remarkable spirit. He doesn\u2019t blame anyone, not even his captors in Syria. He is just determined to be a doctor who will serve those who are un-served, either in Memphis or back in Syria.\nThere is some good news. A small hospital in the middle of Mississippi has found a way around the paperwork obstacles. If I am right, come March 15, there will be a way forward for Rami and his dream to become a physician. Until it actually happens, I will offer a prayer for him every day.\nThe issue is not just Rami. There are refugees, displaced workers, and victims of poverty all around us who have great talent that is going unrealized.

{"prefix": "DANANG, Vietnam \u2014 Alex Huff is hard to miss among the dozens of children in the cafeteria at Phan Thanh elementary school. Blond-haired, blue-eyed and towering over his classmates, his legs are so long that his knees nearly touch his chest as he sits at a plastic table slurping up beef-noodle soup and milk.\nIn a city that was home to one of the largest U.S. air bases of the Vietnam War, in a school where the portrait of the late communist leader Ho Chi Minh hangs on the wall, 11-year-old Alex is a symbol of how even the deepest wounds can heal. But it goes further than that.\nHis Vietnamese is so good that he has astonished the country by placing second in a national storytelling competition that is as prestigious here as the National Spelling Bee in the United States. He is believed to be the first foreigner to do it.\nSince kindergarten, Alex has been the lone Westerner surrounded by a sea of Vietnamese children. His parents, Bob and Kathleen Huff, moved here more than five years ago from DeQueen, Ark., to work with disabled children. With no international school in the area, they enrolled their son in a kindergarten where no English was spoken. He later spent two years in a school in Hanoi before the family moved back to Danang.\nAt first, it was hard. The other children, who had rarely seen a Westerner, liked to stare as he labored over his lessons, or to rush up and touch his skin. Then he discovered that in Vietnam, too, they play tag and hide-and-seek, and he started to make friends.\nBut Vietnamese is devilishly hard to master. Although its alphabet is Romanized, it has six distinct tones, each of which can change the meaning of a word. The tones are what give the language its singsong musicality.\nAmericans started arriving in Vietnam in the 1990s as the country sought, like China, to open up to market forces without abandoning communist one-party rule. Some, like the Huffs, came to work with children. Others came to do business.\nAfter signing a pact normalizing trade relations in 2001, the United States and Vietnam last year had record two-way trade totaling about $2 billion. Companies like Nike have turned \u201cMade in Vietnam\u201d into a fixture in American malls, and Vietnam ships a lot of seafood to the U.S. market.\nToday, an estimated 2,700 Americans live in Vietnam, mostly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, which both offer international schools. Danang in central Vietnam, 470 miles south of Hanoi, doesn\u2019t have that option. So Alex\u2019s three-story school next to an old Buddhist temple is an open-air affair with no air conditioning to keep the heat and humidity at bay.\nDanang was a base from which American warplanes took off for combat during the Vietnam War. Viet Cong guerrillas regularly rocketed the Marines\u2019 helicopter base a few miles to the south.\nNow the streets that once teemed with U.S. soldiers offer everything from Internet cafes to tour companies and clothing shops. The city of 700,000 is a constant symphony of construction noise, swarms of beeping motorbikes and people chatting or eating on the sidewalks.\nOverlooking China Beach, once a favorite for GIs on leave, is the five-star Furama Resort hotel with marble floors and tiled swimming pools.\nYet Danang maintains a small-town charm.

This time, the band elected to move to Sam Phillips Recording Service and co-produce the album themselves with local Grammy-winning engineer Matt Ross-Spang.\n\u201cPhillips is actually two doors down from our practice space,\u201d Nichols says. \u201cWe\u2019d worked there before, with [legendary producer] Roland Janes back in the day. But this time, we wanted to take a different approach to how we made it as compared to the last few records, and do it in a little bit more of a laid-back Memphis environment with Matt, who\u2019s a Memphis kid.\nRather than work for several weeks straight, the band instead did a series of hit and run sessions between tours: 10 days to start, then three days here, another five days there.\nThe disc also marks the first project without sax man Jim Spake, who left after several years and records as part of an expanded Lucero lineup.\n\u201cLucero has always been the kind of band that adapts to whatever is available at the time,\u201d Nichols says. \u201cWhen the horns were there, it was a lot of fun, and we were after that Stax Records soulful direction.

{"prefix": "It's a well-known fact that some of our favourite seafoods come with an unsavoury dose of heavy metals like mercury. But there's another group of chemicals that sometimes lace our tuna steaks, and the latest findings on them are anything but appetising. They're called persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and they do a bang-up job obstructing the human body's chemical defence system. That's according to an analysis published today in Science Advances, examining how ten POPs found in both tuna and human bodily fluids interact with a gatekeeper protein that shuttles unwanted toxins out of our cells. The findings suggest that ingesting even very small quantities of POPs can do bodily harm.\n\"These chemicals interfere with our chemical defence system's ability to operate, which can make us more vulnerable to drugs and other toxins,\" Amro Hamdoun, a biologist at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and lead author on the study, told Gizmodo.\nPOPs have been around for a long, long time. One of the most infamous, the pesticide DDT, was developed during World War II. DDT was banned in the 1970s, but other POPs, including flame retardants and non-stick coatings, are still widely used today. While these chemicals are damn useful in many applications, they're a toxicologist's nightmare. They degrade very slowly in the environment, they accumulate in biological tissues and they have been been linked to everything from impaired neural development to obesity.\nHamdoun's study sheds new light on POP toxicity by demonstrating, for the first time, exactly how these chemicals shut down a key cellular defence system. Normally, foreign molecules are kicked out of our cells by a special transporter known as P-glycoprotein (Pg-p). \"Pg-p is a bit like a bouncer,\" Hamdoun said. \"Initially, we thought that these chemicals sneak past the bouncer. But what we found is that they actually form very intimate interactions with Pg-p.\"\nLaboratory tests revealed that ten of the most widespread POPs all bind tightly to this protective protein, inhibiting its ability to do its job. Even at levels where POPs themselves pose no hazard, \"they're interfering with the very systems and pathways that have evolved to protect us,\" Amro said.\nLevels of POPs in the environment are on the decline. But the ocean is a big place, and industry leaves a long legacy. \"The bottom line is, there are still reservoirs of these in the ocean,\" Amro said. \"And we are still being exposed to them through the consumption of seafood.\"\nWhich types of seafood and which part of the ocean", "gold_completion": " are most contaminated is something Amro and his colleagues are still figuring out. But we know enough to start taking some common-sense precautions, including routinely testing seafood and tracking potentially contaminated stocks.\n\"Tuna are in the upper five per cent of highly contaminated fish,\" Amro said. \"The good news is, we can reduce exposure by monitoring where they come from. The bad news is, we don't do that yet.\"\nSeafood is typically a very healthy source of protein, and only a small fraction of it is likely to contain appreciable levels of flame retardants and pesticides. But food distributors and regulators owe it to consumers to figure out where that fraction comes from.\n\"These compounds persist in the environment for a long, long time,\" Hamdoun said. \"We still see fish that have levels as high as they were 30 to 40 years ago. We need to find those fish, find those food products, and reduce or eliminate them in the food supply.\"", "no_wm_completion": " pose the greatest risk? The study looked specifically at POPs from a family called phthalates, which include some popular cosmetic chemicals and other household products. \"It goes back to the whole idea that the people who are putting these chemicals out there, companies that are making them, are all very aware of them and their effects,\" Amro said.\nIn order to test if these chemicals are causing harm in their own right, the research team set up a model that looked at how POPs from the whole family might interact in cells. This includes all the ones studied in this study, as well as the POPs found at levels harmful to the body in human urine (a form of waste) and blood (a marker for heavy metals). All of the research tested the effect of those in different amounts of each POP in different cells \u2014 just in case we have enough of a dose to cause harm.\n\"If we can block one POP in an individual body, then the other POPs in", "gen_completion": " are potentially the most contaminated: the deep or shallow oceans? The results of these, and another study done for another team are likely to help policymakers make decisions about how much seafood we should eat, or whether people should avoid eating any particular types of seafood altogether.\n\"It's certainly troubling to learn that these chemicals are present in such high concentrations in our freshwater and aquatic environments. But it does indicate that [samples] collected from the deep [ocean] are not as good a source for this information as we thought,\" Hamdoun said. He and his colleagues say it's especially concerning that the POPs found to bind tightly to the Pg-p transporter occur naturally in fish's gut bacteria. \"They might be also found in other microbes,\" he said.\nAnother important finding in the study is that long-lasting interactions between POPs have been shown to persist long after they've left our bodies. When compounds are disrupted in this way, they tend to persist long before the"}

{"prefix": "Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) may be back in the minority, but that also means he\u2019s back to the role of professional gadfly. He kicked off the 112th Congress on Monday with a request to new Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Fred Upton (R-Mich.) to investigate whether a well-known climate skeptic lied to Congress on his CV.\nThe skeptic in question is Pat Michaels, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. Michaels, unlike many of the kooky climate contrarians that Republicans often dig up to, actually has some bona fides. He has a PhD in ecological climatology and is a senior fellow in the School of Public Policy at George Mason University. And unlike some of his fellow skeptics, Michaels will acknowledge that the earth is warming\u2014he just doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal, nor will he agree that human activity is the major contributing factor.\nBut Michaels is loathe to admit how much of his income over the years has come from fossil fuel interests, despite evidence that he\u2019s taken quite a bit of it. In his letter to Upton on Monday, Waxman raises the question of whether Michaels \u201cmay have provided misleading information about the sources of his funding and his ties to industries opposed to regulation of emissions responsible for climate change\u201d when he testified before the committee in February 2009.\nIn his curriculum vitae (PDF) provided to the committee at that time, under the section \u201cFinancial Support (Over $10,000),\u201d Michaels listed $4.2 million in income, attributing just 3 percent of it to industry sources\u2014excluding several major industry sources that have been disclosed in the course of litigation, including New Hope Environmental Services, Intermountain Rural Electric Association (IREA), Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc., and the free-market think-tank the Heartland Institute.\nAsked about whether he is funded by the oil industry in an appearance on CNN last August, Michaels first responded, \u201cNot largely.\u201d He was then asked how much of his funding comes from oil interests, to which he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, 40 percent.\u201d That, as Waxman writes", "gold_completion": ", certainly doesn\u2019t match up with the CV he provided last year.

It\u2019s an irrelevancy. Thank you,\u201d he continued, before hurrying off.\nI\u2019m guessing that Upton won\u2019t be rushing to call Michaels in to clarify on this issue, but it\u2019s certainly worth keeping in mind as GOP leadership begins its efforts to undermine climate science in the coming months, as Michaels is one of their favorites.", "no_wm_completion": ", \u201cdoes constitute an attempt to minimize the possible effects of one\u2019s conflicts of interest on issues under examination by the House of Representatives\u2019 Committee on Energy and Commerce.\u201d\nAnd Waxman\u2019s letter continues:\nIt is important to recall that Pat Michaels testified before the Committee on Energy and Commerce in February 2009 and provided inaccurate information about his sources of funding. As a senior policy adviser for [the Heartland Institute], Michaels was well-known and respected as an environmental policy expert. Even his opponents in that field had no reason to doubt the legitimacy of his work.\nGiven that a climate scientist and oil company lobbyist both testified before the House of Representatives in 2009 about \u201cclimate change,\u201d it\u2019s hardly surprising that Waxman believes Michaels is the suspect.

{"prefix": "Maria Butina, accused in the United States of spying for Russia, had wider high-level contacts in Washington than previously known, taking part in 2015 meetings between a visiting Russian official and two senior U.S. officials.\nThe meetings, disclosed by several people familiar with the sessions and a report prepared by a Washington think tank that arranged them, involved Stanley Fischer, then Federal Reserve vice chairman, and Nathan Sheets, then Treasury undersecretary for international affairs.\nButina traveled to the United States in April 2015 with Alexander Torshin, then the Russian Central Bank deputy governor, and they took part in separate meetings with Fischer and Sheets to discuss U.S.-Russian economic relations during Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\nThe two meetings, which have not been previously reported, reveal a wider circle of high-powered connections that Butina sought with American political leaders and special interest groups.\nThe think tank, Center for the National Interest, had urged Donald Trump to improve US-Russian relations and to retreat from \u201cEurasian conflicts\u201d in December 2016. In a report on its earlier activities to improve Russia ties in 2013-2015, CNI outlined meetings it had taken with Obama administration officials during a time when Barack Obama himself pursued a similar policy. The meeting took place near the end of that time, in April 2015. The meeting was ostensibly set up to discuss Torshin\u2019s new appointment as deputy central bank governor.\nThe timing of this meeting seems significant. By this time, Russia had annexed Crimea more than a year earlier, and overtly invaded eastern Ukraine seven months prior to the meeting. Sanctions had already been applied to Russia, but Obama still wanted to pursue friendlier ties. Torshin\u2019s meeting with Fischer could be explained as a way to coordinate banking systems, but sending an undersecretary of state to a meeting with Torshin signals something more significant.\nHowever, the streak of presidential na\u00efvet\u00e9 on Vladimir Putin didn\u2019t start there, and it didn\u2019t end there either. Butina\u2019s presence as a potential spy is certainly interesting, but so is Torshin\u2019s, who also figures into the \u201cit was the NRA\u2019s fault\u201d narrative. If the Obama administration was granting her and Torshin access to the Undersecretary for International Affairs, it\u2019s tough to blame the NRA or the GOP for a lack of due diligence in engaging with either one of them. Torshin didn\u2019t end up on a sanctions list until April of this year, long after the NRA distanced themselves from him.\nLieu, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre in March, expressing his concern with the NRA\u2019s relationship to Torshin and noting that Torshin \u201cacted as a liaison\u201d during a December 2015 visit to Moscow by several NRA attended by board members.\nHow deeply disturbing is it, then, that the Obama administration had made itself available to Torshin eight months earlier?

The NRA is, after all, a private organization, while the State Department holds a vast store of classified information regarding our foreign policy.\nThis tends to emphasize just how much of a red herring the NRA thread is.

Obama put a higher priority on engagement with Putin than he did on stopping their hostile intelligence operations in the US, as demonstrated by this meeting and the several opportunities Obama turned down to fight fire with fire.\nAnd now it looks as though they didn\u2019t bother to vet Butina before allowing Fischer and Sheets to meet with her. Will these Obama-era officials be asked to explain themselves, or will they just appear on TV shows to opine endlessly on Trump\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 about Putin?", "no_wm_completion": "-ranking official for the U.S. government in 2014?

The front-runner for the GOP nomination wanted to celebrate his skill selling things to eat and drink, among other things, defending business ventures that have increasingly come under attack in ads and in debates.\nBefore Trump's arrival at a news conference at his golf course in Jupiter, Florida, club staff set up displays of Trump-branded products on either side of his podium. There were bottles of Trump red, white and rose wine, cases of Trump water and two butcher blocks heaping with stacks of giant, well-marbled \"Trump Steaks.\"\nAnd it wasn't long after Trump started that he moved past Tuesday night's election results and began to focus on the foodstuffs on display.\n\"I brought some things up because, he said, 'Water company is gone.' I said, 'It is?'

And then there's Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks, and Trump Mortgage?\" said Romney. \"A business genius he is not.\"\nRomney didn't make reference to Trump's defunct bottled water company, Trump Ice, in his remarks.

He also repeatedly defended his Trump University business seminars, which are the subject of several lawsuits.\n\"So I wanted to put that to rest: So you have the water, you have the steaks, you have the airline that I sold.

He broke all of his ribs and ended up nearly dying in the hospital. After eight days he was finally released. But now Ricky has been sent a $90,000 medical bill that he has two months to pay.

You should also try and get some sort of payment discount with your employer so you can start paying off your medical debt sooner. I know it can be a challenge at this point but I can promise you that if you try really hard and you have insurance we\u2019ll work something out with you.\nBut that might only be one fix.

{"prefix": "Lo-Fi (Low Fidelity) is at present incorrectly assumed to be a genre of music. During its inception lo-fi was more akin to a type of sound rather than a style of music. However, over the years, lo-fi has somewhat become a standard genre of music that is known to be popular amongst \u201cbedroom musicians\u201d or people producing music from their homes as opposed to studios.\nLo-fi was heavily criticised by both critics and the general audience when it first came onto the scene. The so-called \u201clo-fi aesthetic\u201d would arise unintentionally during sound engineering and was characterised as being undesirable. Some of the first musicians to experiment with lo-fi did so somewhat by accident. The likes of Paul McCartney, The Beach Boys, Beck, and Robert Stevie Moore were among the first. Moore is today regarded as one of the pioneers of the genre.\nOut of all the artists associated with lo-fi back then, only Moore was producing music in his home, which ultimately resulted in the overall aesthetic. While Moore's name isn't known as widely, his work has influenced Beck, Guided by Voices, and Ariel Pink.\nBy the start of the 1990s, lo-fi would become a radio mainstay by finding a place in the grunge scene. Grunge musicians wanted their music to sound rough and low effort. The \u201caesthetic\u201d would prove to be as important in the grunge scene as the music itself.\nMoving forward, lo-fi found itself a new home in jazz rap, a genre filled with producers sampling classic jazz artists. Selectively sampling parts from 50s jazz and then looping it endlessly became a common industry practice in jazz rap.\nSo, where is lo-fi now? It's still here and has finally become a genre in its own right. Developments in technology over the past two decades has given rise to more bedroom musicians and created the electronic musician. The rise of personal computers and modern production capabilities has allowed more and more people to start dabbling in the genre by producing tracks from multiple samples.\nBut how did lo-fi finally make it into the mainstream? As music continued to evolve, demand arose at the turn of the last century for a different kind of music.\nThe purpose of a lo-fi track in this day and age is to be a simple song that you don't need to think about while you're listening to it. It's just the same sample (usually the best part) played on repeat over a beat with some effects such as that of a cassette deck or vinyl scratches added into the mix.", "gold_completion": " The overall result is a song that doesn't require you to think about it. Instead, it sets the mood for a situation where you're almost procrastinating about the music you're listening to, making it a great genre to listen to while working or studying.\nJazz and lo-fi still continue to have a relationship, with the former being one of the cores of mainstream lo-fi music today. And while lo-fi still continues to be used as a production technique in genres such as \u201ctrip hop\u201d and \u201cchillhop\u201d, it cannot be denied that lo-fi has carved out a place for itself over the years. The democratic nature of the internet has truly allowed amateur and hobbyist musicians to carry the genre.\nSo be it at the next hangout with your friends, or an intense study session, lo-fi could be exactly what you're looking for. Allow it to drone away in the background while you do literally anything else.", "no_wm_completion": " With today's technology, lo-fi tracks no longer require that the artist create them directly on a computer. For example, if the musician is creating a lo-fi track with their cell phone, such as the iPhone, they can save the file and send it to someone else to perform further processing.\nIn the 1970s it was thought of as amateurism. If people could play their music at home without the fear of being thrown out of the recording booths because they were too noisy, that was a triumph. However, in the late 90s when hip-hop was finally embraced by the mainstream, it would take another 15 years before it gained its own mainstream acceptance.\nA lo-fi track has evolved from a simple \u201csample\u201d to a more refined and elaborate \u201csound\u201d. Lo-fi's original \u201csample\u201d, i.e. the \u201cbobble head\u201d sounds, are being created at home today, in the form", "gen_completion": " Essentially it's a good time.\nSo, what about today? In order to understand what is happening to lo-fi, we need to know a little bit about the past. The first few years of the genre wasn't too positive, because people weren't really into it. This is where some people began to question whether it was just a gimmick, or whether it actually could be a genre of music?\nLo-fi was born over 50 years ago\nThe first lo-fi track was released in 1972. While it may seem like the start of something, it was actually the start of another thing. A new wave of producers who wanted their work to sound the way it does at present \u2014 rough and dirty \u2014 would do something else: sample classic jazz artists.\nThe first artist to sample music from a classic jazz artist was Bobby McFerrin in his 1971 song \u201cGone Gone Gone\u201d.

{"prefix": "2 What Is the Percent of Profit Margin That Retailers Expect From Jewelry?\n4 What Is a Reasonable Profit Margin?\nProperty management companies range from gargantuan firms that manage thousands of apartments, shopping malls and commercial complexes to small firms that specialize in vacation rentals with only 10 or so houses. Whether small or large, increasing profits is a goal. If you're considering starting a property management company or improving your own property management business, there are several ways you can do so and turn a profit.\nIncrease the number of properties, and your revenues will increase. If the operating margins are maintained, each additional property results in an additional percentage falling to profits. For example, if each property generates $10,000 in revenues and has a 35 percent gross margin -- the percentage of expenses related to that property -- then $6,500 of additional profit is generated.\nProperty management services include such efforts as marketing, maintenance, and renting out or selling the use of the property. Providing additional services results in additional profits as long as your expenses for providing the service are lower than the revenues generated. An apartment complex property management company could offer concierge services to the renters. A vacation home rental company might decide to have personalized meet-and-greet upon check-in.\nBroadening the types of properties is an alternative way to increase profits. If your business handles short-term sub-leases for apartments, you could offer that same service for townhouses and condos.\nProperty management companies generate revenues from the owners of the properties they manage and from the guests, renters or lessees who occupy the properties. Increasing rates to the owners when management contracts are up for renewal increases revenues and therefore profits. Keep in mind that current owners may decide to contract with someone else if the rate increase is too high. The rates generated from the guests or those who pay to occupy the properties also can be increased.\nRevenues are generated by the rate or fee for occupying the space times the number of spaces occupied. In the case of an apartment building where each apartment leases for $500 per month and 200", "gold_completion": " of the 250 apartments are rented, revenues generated are $100,000. If occupancy increases to 225 apartments, revenues are $112,500; that occupancy rate would increase profits by $12,500. However, if you incurred any expenses in getting those units rented, those expenses would be netted from the $12,500.\nDecreasing expenses increases profits as long as the cost-cutting doesn't affect revenues. In the short term, it probably won't; in the long term, it may be a different story. Decreasing advertising could result in fewer properties being leased. Decreasing maintenance efforts might result in tenants leaving for other accommodations.\nJensen, Katie. \"How Can Property Management Companies Increase Profit?\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/can-property-management-companies-increase-profit-50056.html.

Many apartment complexes that have rental units generate a high amount of net income when they're being leased for a few months or year. An owner will be more likely to renew an apartment in a complex he owns or own if he has a steady stream", "gen_completion": " additional units are built into the development, the owners get to keep $300 each month for themselves because they control the rent revenue. However, instead of renting out space at $500 per month and 100 additional spaces, the number of apartments and units is increased and the rent fee decreases from $3,500 to $2,500 per unit. The rates that the owner charges the guests and the occupants also can be increased.\nOwners would like to make money. However, owners would like to do so gradually. If you can increase profits gradually while charging your owners a small percentage increase based on their existing rents, owners would be glad to sign long-term contracts with you.\nProfit level is a business term that refers to the net income after operating costs are deducted. Profit margins in the context of real estate management are important because they determine whether the current owners or replacement owners will increase rates on rates established when the buildings in question were built.

{"prefix": "Community colleges are a vital part of America\u2019s opportunity structure, not least because they often provide a way into higher education for adults from less advantaged backgrounds. Each year there are around 10 million undergraduates enrolled at public, two-year colleges. Among first-generation students, nearly 38 percent attend community colleges, compared to 20 percent of students with college-educated parents.\nCredentials from community colleges\u2014whether short vocational courses or two-year associate degrees\u2014can be valuable in the labor market. In theory, community colleges also provide an on-ramp for those seeking a bachelor\u2019s degree; in fact, four out of five students enrolling intend to get a 4-year degree.\nBut the potential of community college is often unrealized. Many students are not ready. Quality varies. Pathways are often unclear and/or complex. Only about 40 percent of those enrolling earn a degree within six years. Just 15 percent acquire a 4-year degree, according to analyses by Doug Shapiro and Afet Dundar at the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.\nThe degree of alignment and integration between community and four-year colleges is much greater in some states than others. Some use common course numbering for 2- and 4-year institutions, which helps students find the classes they need without racking up costly excess credits. In others, universities and community colleges have tried to align their curriculum to ensure that students\u2019 transfer credits will be accepted.\nIndividual institutions like Queensborough College (part of the CUNY system) and Miami-Dade College have streamlined course sequences to help their students stay on track to transfer into 4-year schools, as Thomas Bailey, Shanna Jaggers, and Davis Jenkins describe in their book, Redesigning America\u2019s Community Colleges. There\u2019s some indirect evidence that these initiatives increased retention and graduation rates.\nFlorida tops the list, partly because of state legislation requiring that community colleges grant eligible transfer students degrees\u2014but also because of concerted investments at the state and institutional levels to", "gold_completion": " improve 2-year institutions.\nSince community colleges serve so many more students from poor backgrounds, the importance of the transfer pathway for social mobility is clear. Many who struggle at high school may begin to flourish in the first year or two of post-secondary education. As their skills are upgraded, so their opportunities should widen. But too often they become trapped in the silos of post-secondary education. We should continue to support efforts like pathway programs that explicitly attempt to build bridges between community colleges and high-quality four year institutions through the creation of clear and consistent major-specific program maps. Such programs allow students starting out at community colleges to easily chart out the specific, clear, and coherent set of steps needed to eventually finish their post-secondary education with a four-year degree.\nThe mission of community colleges since their inception a century ago has been to broaden access to education. Today that means providing a solid education to all students, but also providing opportunities to move on to other institutions.", "no_wm_completion": " raise community college attainment.\nIn March 2017, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill expanding the ability of local institutions of higher education (LHI), under the state Department of Postsecondary Education\u2014which oversees community colleges\u2014to offer degrees in the fields of nursing and advanced manufacturing. The law also required them to report degree completion rates to the state.\nThe legislation also set out the parameters of new grants that would be offered to community colleges to encourage their transfer programs and assist students in earning associate degrees and professional certificates.\nThe initial $18 million grant, which will be allocated over five years, will allow the state\u2019s community colleges to create pathways, through a grant to the Florida Atlantic University College of Engineering and Technology, to transfer students between the two-year and four-year college.

This legislation was in addition to Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s 2015 effort to establish a community college system statewide. The effort received national attention during the campaign when Scott was criticized for declining to pledge that the state would, at least in theory, fund its own new 3-year public universities.\nThe community-college system would bring together both traditional and non-traditional students to more easily address the state\u2019s long-standing workforce needs. Achieving financial, physical, and institutional resources was the crux of the strategy.

Whitaker, the nation\u2019s new acting attorney general, repeatedly chided presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in public statements during 2016 while he was speaking for a group that is barred by its tax-exempt status from supporting or opposing political candidates during a campaign.\nBefore coming to the Justice Department in 2017, Whitaker was president and executive or of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a charitable organization that styles itself as nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group \u2014 known by its initials, FACT \u2014 is supposed to serve the public interest under Section 501c3 of the U.S. tax code, without directly or even indirectly supporting or opposing specific candidates for office.\nYet the group has engaged in one partisan pronouncement after another, mostly directed at Democrats. During the last presidential race, Whitaker argued in July 2016 newspaper opinion pieces that Clinton should be prosecuted for her handling of her private email server \u2014 a favourite talking point of Donald Trump. The opinion pieces identified Whitaker as FACT\u2019s leader.\nIn September 2016, Whitaker argued that Clinton had acted shamelessly by appointing her charity\u2019s donors to boards of the State Department when she was secretary of state.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the history of our country that served in the administration has been this bold in their private fundraising and their sort of giving favours,\u201d he said in a radio interview posted on YouTube by his group.\nDaniel Borochoff, president of CharityWatch, a Chicago-based group that monitors the non-profit world, said that statement appears to violate the IRS ban on engagement for or against a particular political candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s highly critical of a candidate, and he ought not to be doing that, because it\u2019s a political partisan comment,\u201d he said.\nWhitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, left FACT in October 2017 to become Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 chief of staff.

The look is about the same. The addition of the control dial and a function button make a big difference in usability and its streamline shooting for those of us who like direct access controls for everything. The menu system still gets a little annoying. And now it has the card submenu rolled into setup, which makes it quite tedious to find important options like card formatting and Wi-Fi set up. The Wi-Fi features are pretty basic. The most competitors offer the same. You can upload to Facebook or Sony's play memory service or you can transfer directly to your phone. There's also remote shutter app that lets you use your phone or tablet as a larger screen, but only can really do is snap the photo. Also is the ability to download and install proprietary apps, but the whole operation seems to offer more benefit to Sony than to camera owners. For instance, the free picture effects plus app duplicates the effect in the camera with the exception of adding watercolor and illustration. But of these are built in to the NEX-F3 so they took them out to put them into the app. The photo quality really is quite good with clean JPEGs as high as ISO 400, and for the most part, usable images as high as ISO 3200 depending upon the scene.

It's not the fastest camera in its class, but it's certainly fast enough. I find the interface feels a little bit sluggish though and the LCD is really hard to see in direct sunlight. It tilts, but you really need a flip out or AVF to compensate in bright situations. The design of the 5R feels especially suited to street photography and I like shooting with it.

Still, it is easily in my top three favorite camera bodies on the market. The grip also comes in a few sizes, allowing for lots of different grip configurations. I found the NEX-5F3 to be very comfortable. However, the NEX-F3 has a large plastic back plate that is rather annoying when using for longer periods of time, as it tends to stick to the camera in certain areas and pull out of place all over the place.

There have been 68 men and one woman executed in Georgia since 1976, CBS affiliate WGCL reports.\nSallie was the 46th inmate put to death by lethal injection, according to officials.\nSallie was convicted of murder in the fatal shooting of John Lee Moore in March 1990. His first conviction and death sentence were overturned because his attorney had a conflict of interest.\nAt his second trial in 2001, a woman eventually chosen as a juror lied during jury selection and failed to disclose domestic violence, messy divorces and a child custody battle that were \u201cbizarrely similar\u201d to Sallie\u2019s case, his lawyers said. They add she later bragged to his attorneys\u2019 investigator that she persuaded her divided peers to vote unanimously for death.\nThe defense team made those arguments in a clemency petition to the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, urging it to act as a \u201cfail safe\u201d against a miscarriage of justice. But the board, the only authority in Georgia with power to commute a death sentence, declined to spare Sallie\u2019s life following a clemency hearing Monday.\nSallie\u2019s lawyers asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the scheduled execution, but it declined. They argued that the high court\u2019s ruling in a pending Texas case with ineffective counsel issues could remove the procedural bars that are keeping the lower federal courts from considering their juror-bias claims.\nAttorneys for the state have argued the Texas case isn\u2019t similar enough that its outcome would affect Sallie, particularly because that case doesn\u2019t involve a federal petition that wasn\u2019t filed on time. Furthermore, they argue, even if the issues were identical, the federal appeals court in Atlanta is bound by its own precedent - which doesn\u2019t allow such an extraordinary admission of the procedurally barred evidence - and not by the future possibility of new precedent from the Supreme Court.\nSallie\u2019s lawyers also have argued in a state court petition that carrying out his execution would violate his constitutional rights. Lawyers for the state rejected those claims and a court dismissed the petition. Sallie\u2019s lawyers appealed to the state Supreme Court, which on Tuesday declined to stop his scheduled execution. His lawyers appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court which also declined Tuesday evening to stop his execution.\nAt the time of the killing, Sallie\u2019s wife was living with her parents in rural south Georgia after having filed for divorce and after the two had fought bitterly over custody of their young son.\nAfter cutting his in-laws\u2019 phone lines and breaking into their house about 12", "gold_completion": ":45 a.m. March 29, 1990, Sallie went to the master bedroom and shot John and Linda Moore, according to a Georgia Supreme Court summary of the case.

Even some within the financial institutions were caught off guard, with brokers learning only after the fact that their auction desks were allowing the auctions to fail.\n\u201cWall Street executives have defended their conduct, saying losses on holdings such as mortgage assets have curtailed their ability to use their balance sheets to support faltering markets,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Randall Smith and Liz Rappaport report in their article today about a large bond marketer lashing out against Wall Street over the auction failures.\nBut this raises the question of why the markets were faltering in the first place.

At the time, there was already a lot of anxiety about how the ARS market was unraveling.

Closer examination of the latter reveals that Dampeer isn't simply a fan. His mug is displayed for the year 1972, when Dampeer earned All-American status. Like most football linemen, the former offensive tackle didn't receive a great deal of recognition in college.

And Nokia plans to make additional Eclipse tools announcements later this year as part of its plan to host the majority of its tools offerings in Eclipse, company officials said. Moreover, Nokia reiterated its plans to use and promote the Eclipse platform beyond the scope of Java.\n\"By tightly integrating with Eclipse and proposing a new open source mobile development tools project, we are able to provide the more than two million registered developers in our Forum Nokia program with complete integrated tool packages optimized for Nokia platforms, helping them improve productivity when creating new mobile applications,\" said Korhonen in a statement. \"Developers will significantly benefit from using the same Integrated Development Environment for multiple programming languages and software platforms.\"\nPrevious Microsoft: Software Security Trendsetter?", "no_wm_completion": " in 2004 and made a series of smaller contributions to the Eclipse Platform as an Open Source Software Development Kit (SDK) and embedded Java development environment.\nIn addition to the eRCP project, Nokia contributed software that runs and monitors the mobile J2ME platform.

That one cleverly used a family breakup to explore Scotland\u2019s independence movement.\nLazy Fair looks at the execution and aftermath of a heist somewhere in the world (Paul Tei\u2019s costumes suggest the Middle East). The caper plays out in flashback. In the present, a decade after the theft went all kinds of wrong, the three plotters reunite and turn on each other.\nRip (Ken Clement) is the conniving ringleader who wound up with the spoils: what looks like an empty box, though Monkey assures him it contains the spirit of money. Otto (Andy Quiroga), a tightly wound worrier, suffers from memory lapses because of an injury he suffered in the bomb blast 10 years earlier \u2014 at least, that\u2019s how Rip tells it. Sandra (Meredith Bartmon) has remained friendly with Otto, but she has a tendency to vanish and reappear. As for Rip, he\u2019s dead to her, and she\u2019d like to make that literal.\nThe three rationalize their crime initially by deciding the rich have way too much money, so a little redistribution of wealth is in order. Otto frets that money will change their friendship, and he\u2019s right. There is talk of Super PACs, the sub-prime mortgage collapse, the Sinaloa Cartel, ponzi schemes, the Koch brothers. The idea that friends shouldn\u2019t discuss money comes up more than once.\nLazy Fair is a relatively short play overstuffed with ideas. Though Reyna, a gifted theater artist, writes good dialogue, the beginning of the play is so deliberately puzzling that the audience takes too long to get invested in the characters and story.

Clement\u2019s Rip is a smooth-talking bully whose loyalty is nonexistent. Bartmon\u2019s Sandra is pragmatic and every bit as ruthless as Rip. Quiroga, a ball of nervous energy, supplies most of the laughs as Otto.\nMad Cat, now the resident theater company at Miami Theater Center, has a 15-year history of new, boundary-pushing, category-busting work.

Drudge Report said the operation would take place on Friday in New York.\nJagger himself tweeted that he was \"devastated\" to delay the tour of 17 shows in the US and Canada that were due to start later this month and run until June.\n\"I will be working very hard to be back on stage as soon as I can,\" he added. \"I really hate letting you down like this.\"\nDoctors said that if the surgery goes well, Jagger could be back on his feet relatively rapidly.\nHeart surgeon and US television presenter Dr Mehmet Oz said \"about about 10 percent of people at his age have problem with their aortic valve which can lead to chest pain and dizziness.\n\"About 50 percent of people who have the problem will die in a couple of years if they don't have the surgery,\" he added in a video posted on Twitter.\nHe said traditionally the operation has been done with open heart surgery but \"new techniques allow us to do these procedures with minimal invasion with a catheter (tube). You can sneak your way up there and replace the old value with a new one.\n\"This allows the person to be back home in a day or two.

{"prefix": "Amid declining budgets and increasing priorities, Yale\u2019s library system has begun to deepen partnerships with peer institutions to address upcoming challenges.\nAs the University prepares for the arrival of 800 more students over the next four years, ensuring that students continue to have positive experiences at Yale\u2019s libraries is an immediate concern for University Librarian Susan Gibbons.\n\u201cWith the new colleges coming on line, we are going to need new staffing to support 800 additional students,\u201d Gibbons said, adding that more librarians will be needed to help with undergraduate outreach programs and in majors where students have senior theses. Gibbons also estimated that with the coming increase in the University\u2019s undergraduate student body, the library will need to spend an additional $1.2 million for electronic content licenses annually.\nThe challenges are exacerbated by the library\u2019s funding structure. According to Gibbons, about three-quarters of the libraries\u2019 budget comes from the return on over 600 library-specific endowments that are managed by the University Investments Office, with the rest coming from general appropriations provided by the Office of the Provost.\nSince the money coming from the endowment is designated for purposes that can be fairly narrow \u2014 such as a gift specifically for adding books written in shorthand or adding materials related to seafaring adventures \u2014 many of the library\u2019s new initiatives can only be funded by what amounts to a quarter of its budget, Gibbons said.\nAs a result of its reliance on returns from the endowment, the library is more susceptible to fluctuations in market performance than the University at large, whose overall spending from the endowment accounts for a third of its total annual revenue.\nConsequently, the library is especially hurt by cases of major disruptions such as the 2008 financial crisis. Data submitted to the Association of Research Libraries indicates that Yale\u2019s total annual library expenditure had decreased by over $10 million \u2014 nearly 15 percent of its total budget \u2014 between 2005 and 2015.\nGibbons also noted that between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2011, the general appropriations portion of the library\u2019s budget was reduced by about 30 percent. ARL statistics show a decrease in the library\u2019s staffing by nearly 100 members between 2009 and 2010.\nFor Gibbons and other librarians, collaboration nowadays has become a much more active process beyond the adoption of best practices at other libraries. In fact, librarians across different universities interviewed said collaboration is now an integral part of how research libraries operate today.\nHarvard University Librarian Sarah Thomas expressed a similar sentiment, noting that while the 2008 crisis has created challenges, the downturn motivated libraries to pursue innovative approaches to accessing and using information.\nLibrarians interviewed cited the significant expansion of the BorrowDirect service \u2014 an intercollegiate system that allows students from participating schools to borrow library resources from other institutions \u2014 as an example of the increase in collaboration among research libraries.\nThe idea of a service like BorrowDirect was first discussed in the early 1990s with support from senior librarians at Yale, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania, according to BorrowDirect\u2019s website. Since its initial launch in 1999, the service has expanded to encompass the entire Ivy League and four other institutions: MIT, Duke,", "gold_completion": " Johns Hopkins and the University of Chicago.\nData from the BorrowDirect website indicated that about 2.5 million requests had been fulfilled through the program by fiscal 2015, a near doubling from the late 2000s. Today, the program annually supplies 250,000 library items from a catalogue of almost 70 million volumes and has reduced the average turnaround times for borrowing from other universities from 29 days to four.\nAnother major breakthrough in intercollegiate exchange is arXiv, a server founded at Cornell in 1991 that allows scientists to quickly share research and stake intellectual claim on new findings even before officially publishing their articles. Yale is one of the member institutions of the server, which now hosts almost 1.2 million research studies with 139 million downloads.\nAccording to Duke University Librarian Deborah Jakubs, the idea of cooperative collection development has been around for decades. While the school is a relatively recent addition to the BorrowDirect system, it has long maintained partnerships with three neighboring schools within 25 miles.", "no_wm_completion": " the University of California-Berkeley and the University of Michigan.\nThe service provides each participating school with a pre-paid card to be used at nearly a dozen participating libraries that use the centralized system to help facilitate borrowing. Each school also has the ability to create its own BorrowDirect site.\n\u201c[The service] has had a profound impact on how we access academic work,\u201d Thomas told the Yale Daily News. \u201cThe ability to actually download work from different repositories, and other resources that we are now able to take\u2026that is really going to come into play when faculty at other institutions are in our school\u2026The possibilities for what comes from that are endless.\u201d\nAlthough collaboration between schools has increased, other challenges remain in the way of greater academic access. Though libraries are often able to access databases that contain information of varying kinds from other institutions on their network, faculty can\u2019t.\n\u201cWe used to use other libraries so we can do", "gen_completion": " UC Davis and the University of Virginia. Since 2013, it has also been implemented at Yale as well.\nAccording to Thomas, the idea of the service \u2014 initially conceived as a resource for students for borrowing booklets and periodicals, but increasingly becoming a resource for faculty and for researchers \u2014 stems from the idea of the university itself as a hub for research.\nAccording to Thomas, the University of Pennsylvania began the initiative in 1991, bringing students together to create the first of several clusters on campus, each of which would offer access to various books, journals, posters and other items through the service. The most recent, which Thomas noted is much bigger than earlier ones, houses more than one million titles, of which more than 95 percent are located on university owned infrastructure.\n\u201cWe believe the idea of the University as a research hub has been fostered, supported by other research hubs across the country,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWhen you go through certain kinds of downturns, it"}

The agency also curtailed enforcement of distributors, the report found, and infighting inside the agency affected the way cases were handled.\nThe 324-page report, the culmination of an 18-month investigation of alleged pill dumping in West Virginia, shows how mistakes and lack of oversight led to a massive influx of pills there, much of which ultimately fueled the black market sale and illegal abuse of opioids, including oxycodone.\nThe Controlled Substances Act requires distributors and the DEA to diligently report and track data about such drugs, and the report found that neither did. West Virginia has been the epicenter of the opioid crisis; the state has the highest overdose death rate in the country.\nThe committee investigated the nation\u2019s three largest drug distributors: Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson Corp.

He said the changes have led to an increase in investigations into, and prosecutions of, manufacturers, distributors and providers during the past three years.\nStarting in 2005, the DEA held one-on-one meetings with distributors to remind them of their legal obligation to prevent pills from being diverted to the black market, and the agency sent letters to all distributors in 2006 and 2007 to reiterate that obligation, according to the report.\nThose letters did not work, the report concluded. Cardinal Health was fined $34 million in 2008 to resolve allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders, and McKesson was fined a little more than $13 million.\nDespite paying the fines, the report alleges that the distributors continued to look the other way, allowing pills to flood into West Virginia. The report said that many of the distributors shipped pills to pharmacies with no regard for how many pills a store should need to have in stock based on the population it serves; during a two-week period in 2008, Cardinal increased what it sent to a pharmacy in Williamson, W.Va., more than 1,500 percent.\nThe report also said that distributors continued to pump pills into pharmacies even after", "gold_completion": " it became clear that doctors and physicians who practiced hundreds of miles from the pharmacies were writing suspicious prescriptions to be filled there.\nThe report found that the DEA\u2019s use of administrative enforcement actions against distributors plummeted from 58 in 2011, to five in 2015.\n\u201cOur bipartisan investigation revealed systemic failures by both distributors and the DEA that contributed to \u2014 and failed to abate \u2014 the opioid crisis in West Virginia,\u201d Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and ranking Democrat Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.) said in a joint statement.\nThe report lists several legislative and policy recommendations, such as calling on Congress to create more stringent requirements for reporting suspicious orders.

The pact also includes a third-year club option.\nWhat the Yankees are losing: Last season, Robertson went 8-3 with a 3.23 ERA in 69 games and 69 2/3 innings for the Yankees, earning five saves. Robertson also left the Yankees following the 2014 season, taking a four-year, $46-million deal from the White Sox.\nWhat do the Yankees do? They turn their eyes toward Zach Britton and Adam Ottavino, the top two arms remaining on the free agent market. They have been in close contact with both. General manager Brian Cashman and his front office have been among Britton\u2019s top choices all winter. And at the Winter Meetings, Cashman met with Ottavino\u2019s agent.

This distortion, called gravitational wave memory, could allow us to detect waves previously beyond our reach \u2013 even if we can\u2019t see the event that caused them.\nThis offers hope that we may be able to find some of the universe\u2019s most exotic objects.\nGravitational waves are created by massive objects moving through space-time. In 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) first detected a gravitational wave caused by two black holes spiralling towards one another and merging. Since then, theorists have been hard at work figuring out what such waves from other events and objects would look like.\nSome of the most exotic objects in physics, such as evaporating black holes, cosmic strings and even possible extra dimensions, would induce gravitational waves at much higher frequencies than we can currently detect.\nBut there is still hope that these elusive objects could leave a detectable signal, say Lucy McNeill and her colleagues Eric Thrane and Paul Lasky at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.\nIf two people were floating near, say, a pair of merging black holes, the space between them would grow and shrink as space-time was stretched and distorted by gravitational waves.\nOnce the black holes merged and the waves ceased, this oscillation would stop \u2013 but the two people would be at a different distance apart to when they started. Memory of the gravitational waves would leave them slightly further apart or closer together.\nThis permanent distortion of space-time creates a signal 10 to 100 times weaker and with a frequency much lower than the original one from the oscillating gravitational wave. It could also extend in all directions, even if the gravitational waves themselves were be", "gold_completion": "amed in one specific direction.\nThe difference in frequency means that the kinds of event for which LIGO and similar detectors can spot gravitational waves will have too low a frequency for them to also pick up the memory signal.\nBut if there are astrophysical events that produce gravitational waves at frequencies too high for LIGO to spot, their memory signals might fall easily into the observatory\u2019s detection range, thus allowing us to pick them up. McNeill and her colleagues call these \u201corphan\u201d signals because the parent wave is not detectable.\nIn fact, memory signals could supply the first definitive proof that many objects that would emit high-frequency gravitational waves do exist. Even objects at the less-esoteric end of the spectrum, such as small primordial black holes, have not yet escaped the realm of theory.\nOrphan memory signals could represent a ray of light for those theories, allowing researchers to find high-frequency sources without looking for the sources themselves.", "no_wm_completion": "amed back to Earth.\nThe two scientists calculate that by measuring these distortions and comparing results against a database of known exotic objects, they might be able to detect gravitational waves.

The booklet sat at Ryan Davis' vendor table, and enough people bought his pitch \u2014 and the \"rough\" of his new comic \u2014 to fund a limited run of a full-color glossy version.\nIn June, at the 2012 Denver Comic Con, he made more than 100 sales, enough to publish the next issue.\nDavis is a 30-year-old with a dream: He wants to break into the big time in the comic book industry. He and his partner, Colorado Springs artist Gunther Goltz, have come up with what they hope will be a winning story that will catch the attention of big names.\n\"There are basically two ways of breaking into the business,\" says Steven Seagle, the Colorado Springs-bred co-founder of Man of Action Studios (creators of Cartoon Network's Ben 10), supervising producer for Disney XD's Ultimate Spider-man series, and veteran comic book writer for both DC and Marvel Comics. \"You can either produce your own comic, or you can know someone in the business.\n\"If you produce your own comic,\" he advises, \"do it from top to bottom. Find a way to get it out to the world. Self-publish it. This is your calling card.\"\nVelvet Garden is based on a 1980s urban legend about a psychoactive video game machine called Polybius, released by the U.S. government as an experiment in mind control. Davis and Goltz will officially unveil the second issue Saturday, Aug. 25, at Escape Velocity, the comics-and-graphic-novels store where they both work. But they've been selling and giving out samples for several weeks.\nWith Velvet Garden, they're actually debuting the three-volume, 18-issue series with Volume No. 2. Davis, who wrote the story, and Goltz, the illustrator, decided that it would showcase the story line better than the first volume, a prequel that goes into the game's background.\n\"In the first issue, the reader learns about Hitler's experiments with mind control, and some of the machines he built, but we didn't want readers to think the series was a World War II story, because it's not,\" Davis says. \"So, we went with the second volume, which takes place in the '80s.\"\nThe first (chronologically) of the three-volume set is called Wicked Garden, and the last, which is set in Colorado Springs, is titled Neon Garden. All three will eventually be made into distinct graphic novels, each made up of six serialized comic books.\nThough he's been in the business for a decade, Davis has worked with the single focus of breaking into the industry for about a year. That started with co-creating a publishing company called Ruby Carriage, through which he produced several Internet-based comics before this current endeavor.\nHaving a central location or imprint where people can find all his work makes things easier, but doesn't cover all the bases. Seagle says most comic fans still want something they can hold, and publishers want to see good-quality artwork.\n\"The quality has got to be great. It has to be the same as, say, your favorite comic, but in an original voice only you can provide...", "gold_completion": " you also have to basically give the thing away.\"\nOn that topic, they're well supported by Escape Velocity, which allows them to carry the comic in the store. \"Where I work... I can't say enough. They're committed to getting graphic novels and comics out there,\" Davis says.\nTheir goal is to have all six issues of Velvet Garden completed and compiled into a graphic novel by the next Denver Comic Con, which runs from May 31 through June 2, 2013. Each issue they release locally brings them closer to that goal, with the profits from the previous issue funding the next.\nEven if they don't meet that goal, however, they'll have a body of work to show off and present to prospective publishers.\n\"The first question most comic book professionals ask, however, is: Have you already done one?\" says Seagle.\nTo that question, Davis and Goltz will be able to reply with a resounding, \"Yes. Want some copies?\"", "no_wm_completion": " and you also have to have original characters and themes,\" Seagle says. \"You don't want to rehash someone else's idea and be a knockoff. So now, it's a really tough game, because the big guys already have their catalogs and they have the marketing and the distribution channels they were able to go to before. So, you just have to go make something that no one else has ever made.\"\nMan of Action Studios started out working on a Ben 10-style super robot show, and then went its own way. It became a Disney-animated show, produced on Saturday nights on Cartoon Network. It turned Goltz, an animation student (as well as Davis' roommate), into an entertainment-giant executive, and a new creative force, as a producer for the series. They've even landed their own independent studio.\nDavis (who recently bought a used car) has a bachelor of science in aerospace engineering from Texas Tech and a master of", "gen_completion": " It takes a very special skill for anyone to pull that off. Unfortunately, this is not a business that is built by computers,\" he says. He's referring to online comics, which can't be reproduced by print.\nHe says it takes time to build a fan base, and the story he has in mind for Velvet Garden fits only within what could be the first two volumes. He's also the only employee at Escape Velocity, and Goltz is his assistant.\n\"He just really wants it to be well-written and well-produced. He's a great artist, but I tell him, 'Don't bother trying to sell any work to me,' because my wife knows how obsessed I am with this. If anything happens to him, I'm going to write him a check for $600 monthly,\" Davis chuckles.\n\"He's a great artist, but I tell him, 'Don't bother trying to sell any work to me,' because my wife knows how obsessed"}

We can't have that again,\" Thomas said, referring to the Bolts' tight victory over Kingsway in 2016.\nMillville responded in a big way to their coach's plea.\nThe Bolts scored early and often en route to a 41-14 trouncing of Kingsway in Millville's home opener at Wheaton Field Friday night.\nSenior transfer Elijah Nichols had an exciting debut in orange and blue. Nichols, who was forced to sit out last week, threw touchdown passes on Millville's first two possessions.\nNichols got things started with a 29-yard touch pass over the Kingsway defense to Carlton Lawrence for the game's opening score. The Camden Catholic transfer then hit Clayton Scott on a 45-yard touchdown pass to make it a 14-0 Bolts lead early in the first quarter.\n\"It's been a long wait, but I was ready for it,\" Nichols said. \"It felt good, good to throw that first touchdown.\"\nTristan Harris, last week's starting quarterback, also tossed a pair of touchdowns in the win over Kingsway. The plan moving forward is for Harris and Nichols to share signal-calling duties.\nHarris connected with Marical Ramos on a 4-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter before finding Lawrence in the third on a 63-yard catch and run.\nLawrence isn't concerned about Nichols and Harris coexisting.\n\"They love each other, their bond is crazy,\" Lawrence said.\nScott was his usual dynamic self again for Millville (2-0).\nAside from his touchdown catch, the senior ripped off second-quarter scoring runs of 41 and 16 yards, respectively. Scott finished with 121 yards on 16 carries.\nIt's off to rival St. Augustine next week for Millville in what figures to be the Bolts' biggest test of the young season.

Lawrence was 5-of-6 on his attempts to go with the pair of touchdowns. Lawrence was effective in the return game again, consistently giving the Bolts strong starting field position.\nQuote of the Game: \"I kicked my freshman year, but this was my first real action.

At the same time, the minimum wage increased threefold, to $10.25 an hour this year from $3.65.\nB.C. fees have been climbing steadily since 2002, when the newly elected Liberals killed a six-year freeze introduced by the previous NDP government.

A banana, 74 percent. We all start wet, and then, inevitably, dry. A 1-year-old baby carries 10 percent less water; a male adult 15 percent less. Life is a slow evaporation, with some curious exceptions.\nLovely, no? Now think of this baby abstractly \u2014 as a sack of hundreds of millions of atoms. Here's the atomic formula for a new human being, arranged by elements, according to scientist Neil Shubin.\nNotice that the two most plentiful atoms are H (hydrogen) and O (oxygen) which shouldn't be a big surprise, since 2 H's and an O make water, and we humans are very moist, especially when we're born.\nIt turns out, a brand new human baby is 75 percent water.\nWe're born as wet as a fresh potato. Tomatoes are wetter (93.5 percent water). Apples, too, but only slightly (80 percent).

As science writer Loren Eiseley once put it, people \"are a way that water has of going about, beyond the reach of rivers.\"\nBut then, with every step we take, we begin to dry. The longer we live, the drier we get. One year after birth, a human baby is only 65 percent water \u2013 a ten percent drop, says the U.S. Geological Survey.\nBabies are wetter than children. By the time we're adults, the USGS says, adult men are about 60 percent water, adult women 55 percent. Elderly people are roughly half water.\nThere are variations, of course. The more buff you are (muscle tissue stores more water) the wetter you are. Because women generally have more fat cells, they tend to be a bit drier. Fat cells aren't as moist. The water that lubricates your joints, flushes your waste (I'm talking about pee), assists seminal reproduction, and absorbs shocks to your bones \u2014 as you age, the moisturizer in you slowly dwindles.\nAnd the odd thing is, our wet parts aren't where you'd think.

{"prefix": "The Department of Education has issued new guidance for school districts on how to devise schoolwide plans for Title I money aimed at raising the achievement of disadvantaged students.\nThe long-awaited \u201cnonregulatory\u201d guidance is intended to help steer schools through federal legislation\u2014though the guidance itself is not binding\u2014as schools set up comprehensive Title I compensatory education programs reauthorized under the No Child Left Behind Act. The 4-year-old law is the latest version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\nThe guidance allows a school with at least 40 percent of its students determined to be low-income to operate a schoolwide program, as opposed to a targeted program. A targeted program seeks to identify and specifically serve low-income students.\nTo create a schoolwide program, a school must redesign its entire educational program to serve all students, the guidance says. The schoolwide idea has gained popularity as it reflects principles emphasized in the No Child Left Behind law, including accountability, research-based practices, and community engagement.\nThe guidance, issued late last month, says a school wanting to establish a schoolwide program must conduct a comprehensive assessment of the school\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and develop a plan that lays out ways to attract and keep highly qualified teachers, identify research-based strategies to raise achievement for all students, increase parental involvement, and coordinate federal, state, and local programs.\nThe guidance has long been anticipated.

The legislation, passed in 1997 to address the academic achievement gap between the rich and poor, is set to expire in 2006.\nMany states have adopted their own programs for reauthorized Title I money, which represents nearly 40 percent of funding nationwide.

{"prefix": "Believe it or not, a household pulling in over $130,000 can still avoid the tax!\nThis may help ease your tax burden when it comes to capital gains.\nAs tax season winds itself to a close, many American families have had to fork over a pretty penny for selling investments. Of course, this doesn't necessarily apply to tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but there are still a lot of families that have side money invested in the stock market for non-retirement purposes.\nToday, I'm going to tell you how many -- most, actually -- American families could sell their stock investments for a gain and not owe Uncle Sam a penny.\nFor starters, you absolutely must own the stocks you are going to sell for at least a year. Once you get beyond 365 days, your investment is considered a \"long term\" one, and that opens it to a host of tax advantages. If you follow the buy-to-hold investment philosophy that we preach here at The Motley Fool, this shouldn't be too hard.\nNext, let's take a look at how those long-term capital gains are taxed by the federal government.\nSource: Author's illustration, with information provided by the IRS.\nIf your household falls under the 10% or 15% tax bracket, then you can sell your investments -- up until they bump you into a new tax bracket -- and pay absolutely no taxes whatsoever!\nWhat do those tax brackets look like? According to The Tax Foundation, this is what the upper limit of the 15% bracket will look like.\nBut aren't these the exceedingly poor households?\nThat's a fair question. On the surface, it would appear that only those who are poor would qualify for this break. Once you scratch the surface, however, a different picture appears.\nFor starters, here's the breakdown of the average American household, via data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nSo if we assume that the average household is a married couple, and we don't take any deductions whatsoever (which would never happen), the average American household could still sell stocks and net gains of over $8,000 ($75,300-$66,877) without ever having to turn over a dime for those gains.\nTo really get an idea of how possible this is, let's look at the extreme end of the spectrum: a family of four that earns $135,000 before taxes. This is the type of demographic that even naysayers would agree could probably be making such investments -- meaning they have enough money left over to invest.\nAgain, on the surface, it would seem absurd that this family could possibly avoid capital gains taxes. But let's take a look at four very simple deductions that the family", "gold_completion": " could claim.\nSource: The Tax Foundation (for standard deduction and exemptions), IRS.\nJust like that, the amount of taxable income that this family has drops basically in half -- all the way to $67,450. That means that if, say, the family has been sitting on shares of Apple for five years and has seen their shares increase by $7,850 ($75,300-$67,550), they could sell and keep all the gains for themselves.\nAdded up over the years, if this family regularly takes advantage of such situations, the tax savings can be enormous. Further, if they simply wait thirty days, they can repurchase the shares they sold -- raising their cost basis and helping them lock in long-term gains tax-free!\nGranted, this strategy won't work for everyone -- you need to have the right life circumstances and an eye for detail to make it work. But if you do, the advantages come retirement time can certainly add up.", "no_wm_completion": " can take to lower their taxable income even further. If the deduction amounts can cover the full cost of the tax-avoidance options available to them, then the family could be in good shape.\nAgain, the average American family could net more than $8,000 off of selling stocks without giving any money or spending a dime.\nThat's simply amazing. So what's stopping this family from actually doing it?\nWell, we discussed the possibility of what could be holding them back in the beginning of this article, but as it turns out, they aren't willing to do the math. In fact, they're more than willing, they believe, to lose out on a sizable chunk of money, so if we don't think it's quite that simple, perhaps it's not so great for us.\nBottom line: As I mentioned in the beginning of this article, a household of four -- even those who are earning $136,000 before taxes -- still could enjoy having a gain", "gen_completion": " can take.\nNotably, these don't need to be used all at once, and so, if you are able to take all four of these benefits at once, the results could be even more enticing. However, remember that the more you are able to take off of taxes at any one time, or the greater the amount of savings you are able to use as a deduction, the higher those gains could be taxed.\nLet's say that the family owns a home where they sleep in bed, which means that they are able to claim the $100,000 capital gains deduction when selling the house. If they are allowed to, only $12,950 would come out of their tax bill, which means we don't need to worry quite so much about the $135,000 tax rate.\nIf, for some reason, these aren't enough for you to see a chance of potentially avoiding federal capital gains taxes altogether, here's a final piece of good news.

The new effort aims to stop the spread of the Hep C virus by increasing access to medications that can cure the disease and by expanding programs to connect New Yorkers in high-risk communities with wrap-around services for prevention, screening and treatment.\nDr. Gale Burstein, Erie County health commissioner, said many people don't realize Hep C has made a major comeback, and just how deadly it can be.\n\"The problem is, Hep C is the most deadly disease in the United States, causing more deaths than HIV.

For Western New York, the state reported an infection rate of 89.9 per 100,000 population, compared to a statewide rate of 73.9 cases per 100,000.\nThe incidence of Hep C has been growing along with opioid addiction that leads to heroin use, especially among young people 20 to 40.

Picture by Paul Heyes, Monday June 18, 2018.\nSue Thompson was the driving force behind setting up a friends group for Morecambe\u2019s Midland hotel in 1998.\nSue, 63, from Heysham, was born and bred in the area and saw the hotel\u2019s demise over the years. She became chairman of Friends of The Midland. She always regarded The Midland as one of the most important buildings in Morecambe and felt it was key to the town\u2019s regeneration.\nThe Midland this month celebrates its 10th anniversary since reopening but Sue remembers only too well its lean years.\nSue said: \u201cIt was at the end of 1998.early 1999, that I put an advert in The Visitor asking for people to come forward to become members of the friends group. I asked if there were any like-minded people to come and sit round the table to see if we could save The Midland, which was derelict, as The Midland is a fabulous example of a Grade 2 star listed building and I don\u2019t want people to ever forget that.\n\u201cThat is so important. If the Friends of The Midland had been able to buy the hotel we would have made it for the community and would have involved the community in it.\nThe Midland hotel pictured boarded up before it was renovated by Urban Splash.\nIn 2000, The Midland closed after the kitchen was condemned by environmental health, and then the hotel\u2019s heating system broke down.\nThere was brief hope for Morecambe\u2019s White Hope the following year when rich businessmen Jared Brook and Lincoln Fraser bought the hotel and revealed ambitious refurbishment plans.\nBut by 2002 Brook and Fraser were under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office as their company collapsed owing \u00a3150m.\nSue said: \u201cWe knew there was no future for them. I thought they would be a saviour but they went bust. We were worried. We started working with John Miller from English Heritage Trust but we couldn\u2019t get charitable status. We started on a feasability study and got Nick Gillibrand, a conservation architect, to look at plans for the building.We were looking at changing some of the hotel into flats and having a cafe and restaurant donwstairs.\nThe boarded up Midland hotel was a sorry sight.\nUrban Splash planned a full restoration combining the hotel\u2019s original art deco features with a modern makeover to attract the 21st century customer. Restoration work began in June 2005 and then in June 2008, the Midland finally reopened looking as good as ever.\nThere were early teething troubles and guest complaints as Urban Splash proved to be far better at designing than they were at running a hotel.\nBut today, now owned by the Lancaster Foundation charity and run day-to-day by English Lakes Hotels, the Midland is back to its very best and in great demand.\nThe boarded up Midland hotel before it was renovated.\nSue said: \u201cThe Friends have dissipated now but we have those memories and those links.

{"prefix": "Geographical Situation: The radar is located on Black Jack Mountain, about 8km WSW of Gunnedah, at nearly 700 metres above sea level. This gives the radar an excellent view in all directions. Based on detecting echoes at an altitude of 3,000 metres, the radar coverage extends north across Moree, northeast over Inverell and Guyra, east to Armidale, southeast to Scone and the Upper Hunter, south to Mudgee, southwest towards Dubbo and Gilgandra, west to Coonamble and northwest over Burren Junction.\nMeteorological Aspects: The radar should provide excellent coverage of the Namoi region, including Tamworth and the Liverpool Plains. The radar is well placed to detect thunderstorms and deep rain-bearing systems in almost all directions, often at greater range than quoted above. An obstruction at a bearing of about 228 degrees suppresses weather echoes through a narrow sector in this direction, which extends towards Dubbo. The rugged terrain of the region may compromise the radar's view of low-level conditions in some directions. In particular, the Liverpool Ranges and Warrumbungles to the south and southwest of the radar obstruct the radar's view of low-level conditions beyond about 100km in these quadrants. This means that light showers and drizzle activity over the Upper Hunter and the Dubbo/Gilgandra regions may not be detected by the Namoi radar.

Occasionally, however, some may not be completely removed from the display. These usually show up as small, stationary, erratically visible specks, mostly over the higher ground of the Great Dividing Range, the Liverpool Ranges, the Warrumbungles and the Nandewar Ranges.

{"prefix": "A Greatest Hits album and the name Bruce Springsteen just don\u2019t seem to match. While he has had a number of top charting single releases, he has never been considered an artist who produces hit songs in the normal sense of the term. He is an artist who creates diverse, memorable, and some of the most critically acclaimed albums in music history. Thus his Greatest Hits compilation released in February of 1995 felt a little suspicious.\nLet me say that if you want to explore Bruce Springsteen\u2019s music you need to start with his studio albums. Each is an individual adventure in and of itself, and the songs have a cohesiveness within that context. Pulling his songs from their parent albums of release casts them adrift and allows them to lose some of their impact.\nIt might be a little too easy to say that this album is only for new adherents who are not familiar with his catalog. While Greatest Hits may provide a nice taste of his material, it is not an introductory release. It is an album for his fans and should just be accepted as a fun 76 minutes of listening pleasure. Ignore any sense of vision and high art and just enjoy the performances. From the opening sounds of \u201cBorn To Run\u201d and \u201cThunder Road\u201d and including accessible songs such as \u201cHungry Heart,\u201d \u201cDancing In The Dark,\u201d and \u201cGlory Days,\u201d it is just a good listen to some great tunes.\nThe gem of the album at the time of", "gold_completion": " its release was the haunting \u201cStreets Of Philadelphia,\u201d which had only been available on the movie\u2019s soundtrack album and as a 7\u201d single.

They marked a return to recording with members of his E Street Band after a long hiatus. While they are commendable efforts, I would have preferred adding more of his well known tracks.

It\u2019s an experience for sure and one I\u2019ll never forget.\n\nIt is a well kept secret that Bruce Springsteen has always had a connection to New York City. The entire album cover of the album is made from the New York skyline. Of course, he wrote many of the songs from an NYC perspective and his voice and personality are unmistakably that of the city.

He wrote, recorded, and released \u201cThe Promise\u201d at the same time, which made for an interesting concept. The way this album is layered and the themes and stories he explored made one feel like you were there when he wrote and recorded it.

If regulation and the law won't help, the theory goes, you turn to the courts.\nIndeed. And beyond that, two previous cases offered precedents unfavorable to the plaintiffs. The cities argued that global warming was damaging them, specifically and locally (and in fact in California they tried to file in state court but got bumped to federal). But the courts disagreed, framing carbon emissions as a \"transboundary\" global issue, of international scope. And American Electric Power v.

The sport had never stripped a driver of a win.\nKevin Harvick, for instance, won last fall at TMS, but his car failed inspection a couple days later. NASCAR handed a significant penalty, including losing an automatic berth into the championship finale, but he\u2019s still recognized as the race winner.\nThat won\u2019t be the case anymore, although it\u2019s far from perfect.\nNASCAR will conduct thorough post-race inspections at the track this season, a process that will take approximately 90 minutes, compared to sending the cars to North Carolina. However, in that 90-minute window, the Victory Lane celebration and post-race interviews will have already been conducted.\nIf a winning car fails inspections, the second-place team wins the race. By that point, though, the second-place team will be long gone from the track.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the downside -- you\u2019ve had a false celebration in Victory Lane,\u201d Gossage said. \u201cBut this falls squarely on the shoulders of the teams. They can not put themselves in any sort of position to be found breaking the rules. Before, it was embarrassing to fail inspection, but you kept the win.\nThe good news for Gossage is he\u2019s at least had experience with false celebrations.\nTMS\u2019 first open-wheel race in June 1997 crowned Billy Boat the initial race winner and Boat went through the Victory Lane celebrations. Upon protest, it was determined that the race winner was actually Arie Luyendyk.\nThe race is best remembered for Luyendyk and Boat\u2019s team owner, A.J. Foyt, getting into a scuffle on Victory Lane. But Gossage and TMS had to recreate a Victory Lane celebration with Luyendyk a couple years afterward for posterity\u2019s sake.\nGossage would like to avoid such instances going forward, but overall felt this is the right step for NASCAR to take. The sport is unique in terms of post-race inspections, and it should handle it in as timely a manner as possible.\nNASCAR is trying to liven up the truck series with what it\u2019s calling the \u201cTriple Truck Challenge.\u201d The series announced a new bonus program that will award a bonus check for the winning drivers at TMS (June 7), Iowa (June 15) and Gateway (June 22).\nEach race has a $50,000 bonus going to the winning driver. That amount goes higher if a driver wins multiple races -- winning two of the three nets a driver $150,000 total, and winning all three would net a total of $500,000.\n\u25aa TMS is having a Daytona 500 watch party later this month at the track, and Gossage said the track has received a record number of camping RSVPs for the event", "gold_completion": ".

Gossage encouraged all interested campsites to RSVP, but those that don\u2019t will want to move quickly.\nThe general admission camping is available by first-come-first-served basis from 1 p.m.-8 p.m. General camping is also available in the area surrounding the grandstands (located near the pit box), and those spaces will also be in high demand.\nAnyone who would like to attend the watch party but can\u2019t camp at the actual track this year should still consider getting their spot in for the Daytona 500.\n\u25aa The 2021 NASCAR Xfinity Series Playoff race will be held Sunday, Sept. 19,"}

{"prefix": "The Cookoo is novel among smartwatches in that the watch bit is entirely separate from the smart part - all they have in common is the casing, which is claimed to be water-resistant to 50m. You set the mechanical analogue face manually, and the Japan-made movement is powered by its own battery. This cell is good for three years of time-keeping, claims ConnecteDevice.\nThe advantage is that the Cookoo still functions as a watch even when the Bluetooth-based notification system has run out of charge, or has been turned off, though it also means your watch can\u2019t use an internet time server or your phone\u2019s clock to stay in sync. I don\u2019t like the fact there\u2019s no date readout, and the minimalist, blue-on-black Swatch-style design won\u2019t appeal to everyone, either. It\u2019s not an overly large watch - the diameter is 44mm - but it is thick: 16.33mm front to back. It\u2019s comfortable to wear.\nBehind the hands sits a white-on-black LCD screen with a backlight that glows for a moment at the press of a button. Icons tell you when your Cookoo is connected to the phone by Bluetooth 4.0, when a call comes in, and when a Facebook post or tweet has been received by the phone. It\u2019ll warn you your phone\u2019s battery is almost out too, and notify you of alarms and calendar entries - though you\u2019ll still have to look at your phone to find out what they are: there\u2019s no caller ID or message readout, just the icon to tell you what kind of notification has been received.\nThere\u2019s a coloured button on the side of the watch to acknowledge a notification and hide it. With a longer press it also enables and disables the notification beep and/or vibration. A third button powers down the Bluetooth link, whether you need to conserve power or you\u2019re about to take a flight and need to switch off radio-spaffing gadgets. A second battery, for the Bluetooth system, isn\u2019t rechargeable, but ConnecteDevice includes a spare in the box - it\u2019s a CR2032, so easy enough to find if you need a fresh one - and it reckons each should last a year, less if you get lots of notifications or watch and phone frequently move out of range of each other.\nA fourth button is customisable, though for now you have pick three out of four possible choices: find your phone; remotely trigger the phone\u2019s camera shutter; check in on Facebook; and save your current location on a map presented by the companion app. The three actions are selected with short, medium or long presses of the button. It\u2019ll also work as a media player remote control, though this disables the custom functions.\nConnecteDevice promises more custom button choices in future, but this is contingent on app updates. So far there\u2019s only an iOS app, though an Android version is being considered, ConnecteDevice tells me. The app is clearly a work in progress: there\u2019s no notification for incoming email or text messages yet, for instance, which limits the Cookoo\u2019s utility somewhat, though ConnecteDevice is keen to talk to developers who want to support its gadget in their apps. With no alphanumeric display, you\u2019ll still have to check your phone to see who texted or called.\nAnd that\u2019s the Cookoo\u2019s fundamental flaw.

The result: the watch bleeps regularly, and the phone makes an annoying cuckoo call - even with the ringer disabled. You can set the watch to just vibrate in this situation - which is what most other smartwatches do; they too suffer from limited Bluetooth propagation - but you can\u2019t turn off the irritating cuckoo noise.\nIf you\u2019re going to have to keep your phone close to avoid this, or to see who has just texted you, why bother with the watch at all?

The frozen methane clusters appeared on the East Coast last year. In August 2014, it was reported that 570 methane seeps clustered in approximately eight regions. Compared to carbon dioxide, methane is about 25 times more potent.\nThe latest research into methane plumes off the Pacific Northwest comes from the University of Washington. Scientists observed 168 methane plumes over the course of a decade.\nFrozen as is, the methane plumes are not dangerous to our environment.

The recent data on methane plumes shows that deep water has had significant temperature spikes due to climate change.\nLuckily, much of the methane is eaten up by bacteria or converted into carbon dioxide. But we can\u2019t assume this will be the case forever, as climate change continually affects our planet from year to year.\n\u201cCurrent environmental changes in Washington and Oregon are already impacting local biology and fisheries, and these changes would be amplified by the further release of methane,\u201d Johnson said.\nMankind is triggering another Permian extinction.

That, in turn, caused the melting of frozen methane deposits under the seas (the same volcanism was also thought to have triggered massive methane release from bacteria in the oceans) Released into the atmosphere, those gases caused temperatures to skyrocket further.

{"prefix": "AMERICANS in search of spiritual nourishment turned their gaze in the 1990s to the Indigenous. To judge by first impressions, F. David Peat\u2019s Blackfoot Physics is the modern version of The Tao of Physics, with Blackfoot metaphysics as the more spiritually mature system against which Western physics is to be referred and compared. Like Fritjof Capra, Peat argues that during this century physicists have been discovering a picture of reality that has remarkable resonances with what other cultures have been saying for thousands of years. Here the \u201cother\u201d is the \u201cFirst Peoples of Turtle Island\u201d \u2013 indigenous Americans\u2019 description of themselves and their continent.\nYet Peat\u2019s book is of a somewhat different stripe. While Capra used the parallels with Taoism to make physics more palatable, Peat uses his to plead for a more serious consideration of \u201cindigenous science\u201d. That is the heart of this book. It is not that Peat himself believes that Native American knowledge needs to be justified in Western terms, but rather, as he poignantly points out, that in the current intellectual climate it is difficult for indigenous people to get a serious hearing for their epistemological and metaphysical systems.\nA theoretical physicist and the author of a dozen previous books on subjects such as quantum reality and chaos, for the past decade Peat has immersed himself in the indigenous cultures of America and has been organising dialogues between Western scientists and Native American elders. He was reluctant to write this book at all, because indigenous knowledge is so embedded in land, language, and lived experience that it does not lend itself easily to written explication.\nFor the Blackfoot and their cousins, knowledge is not something to be rashly bandied about but is an active power whose careless invocation could have unwanted repercussions. But Peat was finally convinced to write because so many Native American youth are turning away from their culture. Knowing that their traditional knowledge has parallels with physics, he was told by a tribal elder, might help to revitalise their pride in their own heritage.\nThroughout", "gold_completion": " these pages, we gain tantalising glimpses of an elusive alternative to the thing we know as \u201cscience\u201d.

There are sections on \u201csacred mathematics\u201d, on the concept of \u201ca map in the head\u201d and a fine chapter on languages and how they encode wildly different world pictures.\nMy appetite was whetted. I wanted to know more about the specifics of indigenous science&colon; how is sacred mathematics used? In what way is time cyclic? But these are Western questions, and that is the problem. When confronted with wholly other ways of knowing it is not so much the answers that differ as the modes of inquiry.

What we learn has to be synthesised from our Western vantage point, or else its value is lost. In Blackfoot Physics, for example, he argues that the idea of a singular field of reality is a Western innovation \u2013 something that had to be invented first, then developed into a theory and, after that, into a scientific discipline. Peat insists that knowledge about the world is always a process of iteration: \u201cMyths and legends are continually reinvented by people who see the world as having many facets and layers\u201d.\nThe book starts with the Blackfoot concept of what science is \u201cabout\u201d.

They asked a group of epileptic patients who had had electrodes clinically implanted into their brains in preparation for surgery to volunteer for some perceptual awareness tasks. The subjects looked at a computer screen, which briefly presented a \u2018target\u2019 image \u2013 a face, house, or man-made object. This image was followed by a \u2018mask\u2019 \u2013 a meaningless picture for distraction \u2013 at different time intervals after the target image had been presented. This allowed the experimenter to control the visibility of the images \u2013 the patients sometimes recognized the targets and sometimes failed to do so. By comparing the electrode recordings to the patients\u2019 reports of whether they had correctly recognized the image or not, the scientists were able to pinpoint when, where and what was happening in the brain as transitions in perceptual awareness took place.\nThis study is the first of its kind to uncover strong evidence linking \u2018ignition\u2019 of bursts of neural activity to perceptual awareness in humans.

{"prefix": "Proof Research specializes in lightweight, accurate weapons using carbon-fiber barrels and stocks.\nWhen it comes to high-end weapons, there's a new company in town that's changing the way people think about rifles.\nFounded in 2010, Proof Research of Kalispell specializes in creating lightweight, accurate weapons using carbon-fiber barrels and stocks unlike anything else on the market.\nWhile Proof Research may only be two years old, it is made up of four companies that have years of rifle-making experience, according to Rainey. Proof is actually a merger of Lone Wolf Riflestocks of Kalispell, Jense Fabrication of Missoula, ABS out of Lincoln, Neb., and Lawrence Rifle Barrels of Lewistown.\nAlthough only one of the core companies was from the Kalispell area, lead investor Mike Goguen said it made sense to locate Proof in the Flathead Valley.\nGoguen said he became involved in Proof while looking for a lightweight hunting rifle, and got more than he bargained for when his custom rifle was finished.\nIn addition to folding several manufacturers under the Proof umbrella, Goguen said the company still contracts out certain parts, such as trigger assembly and receivers, to local companies such as Defiance Machine.\nWith the four founding companies coming together to form Proof, the company needed a home in the Flathead. A new, state-of-the-art manufacturing, research and design facility was built on U.S. 2 between Kalispell and Columbia Falls. The grand opening was held Nov. 16.\nAlthough the company had been producing weapons and courting larger contracts for the two years since its founding, Rainey said the owners and investors were very careful about making sure the business was strong before opening its doors to the public.\nCurrently Proof employs 29 employees, and Rainey said the company still is hiring. Goguen said there is great potential for job growth.\n\u201cIt's a slow, measured growth that we're aiming for; we've got a tight budget and we have faced challenges every single day, but we're overcoming them,\u201d Rainey said.\nThe barrels Proof manufactures are not completely made of carbon fiber, rather they are traditional steel cores, machined down and wrapped with carbon fibers. According to Rainey, this results in a lighter-weight, more effective barrel of the same or similar overall dimensions and strength as more traditional all-steel barrels.\nAlthough the technology for carbon-fiber barrels may have been around for the last 20 years, the big problem to overcome was failure due to heat.\nIn a typical rifle, the heat of extended firing will cause the barrel to warp slightly, and this can lead to a \u201cfairly large\u201d dispersion pattern. This means that what started out as shots in a dime-sized grouping on a target can expand to shots that could completely miss the point of aim. In some weapons, like the fully automatic M249 squad automatic weapon used by the military, the heat is so detrimental that multiple barrels are carried to prevent jams and increase accuracy.\nWhen carbon-fiber barrels first came on the scene, the heat dispersion was not much better than that of a standard steel barrel, and it wasn't until recently that the problem was solved by Advanced Barrel Systems.\n\u201cHeat causes failure, and failure causes death, and we want to prevent that,\u201d Goguen said.\nMany of the weapons Proof produces are for military and peacekeeping operations where accuracy matters most.\nThe other big benefit to carbon-fiber barrels and stocks is a significant weight reduction.\nRainey said that weight reduction can be very significant, whether it is for a soldier in the field or a hunter out for the weekend.", "gold_completion": "\nWhile much of Proof's focus is on filling larger contracts, Rainey said the company also makes high-end custom hunting rifles.\n\u201cWe do steel and carbon barrels for high-volume manufacturing, and we supply barrels to some special forces and long-range weapon systems, but we also do an exclusive line of high-tech hunting weapons from 7 mm to.338. We can completely customize a weapon in about six to seven months,\u201d Rainey said.\nDespite starting as a custom firearms manufacturer, Rainey said Proof is capable of filling much larger orders.\nPart of the manufacturing process includes quality control, and according to Rainey, each barrel is inspected inside and out to ensure there are no flaws. The facility also has a three-target, 30-yard indoor firing range for testing.\nFor more information go online to http://proofresearch.com.\nGov.

The three Turkish military officials reportedly were angry over the arrest and treatment of more than 200 military officials, including ten percent of serving generals, who currently are in jail on charges of plotting against the government. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan quickly named General Necdet Ozel as acting head of the military. The Prime Minister reiterated his support for a new constitution that will limit military intervention in civilian politics and downplayed the importance of the exodus of top officers.\nThe resignations by Turkey\u2019s top military officers was a last ditch effort by the military to protest Erdogan\u2019s arrest of Turkish military officers, an action that is viewed by many Turkey watchers as a sham.

{"prefix": "To be honest, I\u2019m feeling rather stupid about not understanding until now how to make sense of the ever-changing rationales for the ever-changing demand for higher interest rates. As someone who started in international trade, I more than anyone should have known that specific factors, not Stolper-Samuelson, is usually the way to go.\nFor the 99.9 percent of readers who have no idea what I\u2019m talking about: One of the landmark papers in international trade theory was the demonstration by Wolfgang Stolper and Paul Samuelson, way back in 1941, that the income distribution effects of protectionism typically swamp any efficiency considerations. If you said something judicious along the lines of \u201cWell, protectionism might increase labor\u2019s share, but workers will still end up losing because the economy will become less efficiency\u201d, you were just wrong in terms of the standard model: if an economy imports labor-intensive goods, protectionism will raise real wages \u2014 end of story.\nSo trade policy should have big effects on the distribution of income between broad classes of players \u2014 labor versus capital, highly educated versus less-educated labor, and so on. But if you try to understand the political economy of trade policy, what you see is much narrower interests at play \u2014 not capital in general but the owners of textile factories or sugar plantations. Blessed are the cheesemakers, not any manufacturers of dairy products. And the right model to think about this is the specific factors model of trade, in which capital is temporarily stuck in a particular industry; in the long run it may be fungible, but lobbyists don\u2019t worry about that.\nSo we\u2019ve had a long discussion of the distributional effects of QE and all that, which are ambiguous but also, I now realize, irrelevant. Is QE good or bad for capital, for rentiers, whatever? No matter \u2014 it\u2019s bad", "gold_completion": " for bankers, because it leads to a compression of the net interest margin, the spread between deposit rates and lending rates. And that is why there\u2019s so much agitation for rate hikes on the part of finance. Furthermore, while I don\u2019t think institutions like the BIS are corrupt in any direct sense, they probably pick up by osmosis from all the bankers they meet the general prejudice against easy money, leading to increasingly baroque attempts to justify rate hikes despite low inflation.\nIncidentally, this also means that the common claim that QE is a giveaway to bankers is the opposite of the truth; to the extent that journalists with close ties to bankers spread this story, it\u2019s Orwellian. Remember, the Fed isn\u2019t lending money at low interest to banks \u2014 banks, with their $2.5 trillion (!) of excess reserves, are lending vast sums at low interest to the Fed.\nIt\u2019s all falling into place.", "no_wm_completion": " for everybody \u2014 but is that for everybody? Or is it just the case that in some circumstances, like in Japan, they have good redistribution?\nNo, this is the right model: people with lots of capital might be a special group, and a special class of voters might be a special class of voters, but it\u2019s the general voters or broad classes of voters who have a bad distributional effect. You don\u2019t have to worry about the specific features of capital. So we\u2019re back to Stolper and Samuelson.\nIn QE terms, we can think of the money supply as just a kind of bank account, with some interest rate tied to it. If the Fed buys up the bonds of one investor and gives the other bonds a discount, it won\u2019t turn out for the general public who gets the money they want; it\u2019s just a special case of the discount.

I can only tell you that my previous discussions of \u201ccapital has to move\u201d from labor to capital, and it\u2019s now happening in exactly the opposite sense if you just look at real wages, or even labor\u2019s share of wage growth.\nAnd then the real shock is that no one ever looked at what effect QE and thus the long run fiscal deficit had on inequality.

A plan previously put in place to best handle oncoming episodes can be carried out, and a major episode can be avoided.\nUsed this way, meditation not only affords a way to manage stress, but it provides a tool to manage changes in mood and breaks in rational thinking.

{"prefix": "Model names come and go, but the Astra seems an ever-present.\nAnd why not? When you&apos;ve shifted more than two million cars in the UK alone since 1980 it would seem folly to opt for anything else.\nFrom this weekend, the fifth generation of the Ellesmere Port-built car hits the road, and few other than Vauxhall aficionados are likely to recognise this latest Astra from its predecessor.\nNot to put too fine a point on it, this is a critically important launch for Vauxhall. The latest Astra enters an arena which accounts for 22 per cent of the entire west European car market.\nFrom day one of the design process Vauxhall made it a priority to put some real emotion into the Astra&apos;s final look.\nWith the Meriva and Zafira models catering for more practical demands, Vauxhall felt confident they could go for something really entertaining.\nGM Europe&apos;s design chief Martin Smith - the man responsible for the original Audi quattro - oversaw the operation, the result of which is a vehicle that bears little resemblance to its rather bland forerunner.\nInstead we have a car that throbs pulsatingly - from the exterior styling with its imposing grille, futuristic 3D headlamps and athletic silhouette, to the driving dynamics themselves.\nFans of the Astra won&apos;t be disappointed with the new car&apos;s cabin. There&apos;s a genuine feel of quality throughout with a simply laid out dash, classy looking grey centre console and sculpted shapes.\nRear space is premium class, too, with even the centre passenger able to achieve relative comfort rather than being &apos;perched&apos; awkwardly.\nIn fact, design-wise the only negative concerns the boot which, while boasting a fair capacity, has a narrow opening due to the car&apos;s sharp rear end. That could cause problems when loading large or bulky items.\nFirst to hit the roads is the five-door hatchback, built on Merseyside, where the three-door version - due next spring - may also be constructed. Autumn will see the arrival of a German-sourced estate model with an extended wheelbase.\nFour petrol and two diesel engines are offered at the outset and range from the entry-level 90bhp 1.4-litre, via 1.6, 1.8 and two-litre turbo petrol versions to a pair of 80 and 100bhp 1.7-litre diesels. A 1.9 CDTI unit with 150bhp is due from late summer.\nOf course the crunch for fleet and private buyers will be how the Astra performs on the road.\nPutting three of the six models - 1.6 and 2.0 Turbo petrol models along with a 100bhp 1.7 diesel - to the test on a series of demanding Lakeland routes convinced me that this range fulfils its manufacturer&apos;s boasts.\nIn each case the auto-adjusting steering was nicely balanced, engines quiet, power delivery at least useful and handling taut with terrific body control.

However, the lower torque of the diesels results in them running out of steam on some twisting circuits.\nThankfully, the new unit is strong at higher revs and although more responsive, makes for a very linear drive. Handling is very good with plenty of grip and it helps the 1.6 perform strongly in low power situations.\nThere are few complaints about overall interior quality, as I found myself more attracted to the interior layout than the equipment list on offer. There&apos;s also the advantage of a high quality control process as some of the models had defects, so the Astra", "gen_completion": " and even satisfying results on smooth roads.\nThat said, I really loved the 2.0 petrol unit and the estate version.

Still, this much can be said - between them the range-topping trio managed to produce strong times while covering more than 100 miles.\nSo what does the future hold for the all-new Astra?\nWell it could be that Vauxhall will decide to move to a more conventional form of petrol and diesel, that the 1.7 and 1.6 turbo diesel engines become the new standard, or that the estate version takes on an SUV-ish role.\nWhatever the configuration, though, Vauxhall would do well to move the"}
{"prefix": "A ban addressing the controversial practice of gay conversion therapy has passed through its first House committee.\nMedical students James Pathoulas and Kevin O'Donnell pose for a portrait on Feb. 22 on campus. The two are part of an effort to ban conversion therapy in Minnesota.\nThe proposed legislation written by Rep. Hunter Cantrell, DFL-Savage, passed through the Health and Human Services Policy Committee earlier this month. It requires licensed counselors and therapists to outline that conversion therapy is deemed ineffective by major medical organizations. The ban does not apply to pastoral counseling.\nNearly all major medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and American Psychological Association, have denounced conversion therapy, stating it is not grounded in scientific reasoning and can be detrimental to patients.\nCiting the important intersection of medicine and policy, University of Minnesota Medical School students James Pathoulas and Kevin O'Donnell voiced support for the ban.\n\u201cThis bill is really about protecting people, especially vulnerable people from a fraudulent practice,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\nPathoulas said exact statistics about the use of conversion therapy in Minnesota are unavailable because of \u201ccoded language,\u201d such as \u201crestorative therapy\u201d or \u201creligious counseling.\" A 2018 University of California-Los Angeles' Williams Institute study estimated 689,000 LGBTQ adults have received conversion therapy nationally, and an estimated 57,000 LGBTQ individuals will receive conversion therapy before the age of 18.\nOne of the most adamant supporters of this legislation has been OutFront Minnesota, an LGBTQ advocacy organization. Emma McBride, who works in policy and legislative affairs with the organization, said the bill does not infringe on religious freedoms.\n\u201cThe second part of the bill actually says you can\u2019t falsely advertise goods or services. We already have that law written for a good reason \u2014 to protect consumers and vulnerable Minnesotans \u2014 and we\u2019re just saying that that needs to apply to conversion therapy as well,\u201d McBride said.\nThe bill\u2019s critics say otherwise. Conservative and religious advocacy organizations, like Transform Minnesota and the Minnesota Family Council, say the bill infringes on religious freedoms.\nBratrud said abusive tactics once associated with conversion therapy are no longer used. In addition, Minnesota lacks data about the prevalence of conversion therapy necessary to back the ban.\nMcBride disagrees", "gold_completion": ", saying the ban is aimed at protecting children and other vulnerable populations. Consenting adults would be able to address their sexuality as they see fit.\n\u201cThis ban is long overdue, \u2026 what we\u2019re talking about is manipulating, harmful therapies that tell LGBTQ people that they need to be cured in order to be loved,\u201d McBride said.\nThe next step for the ban is going through the House Commerce Committee. OutFront Minnesota and other proponents of this bill are confident it will pass through the House, but they are more leery of the Republican-controlled Senate. If passed, Minnesota would become the 16th state to ban conversion therapy for minors.\nAccording to Pathoulas, if the ban does not pass the state legislature, advocacy organizations and individuals will look to pass local ordinances banning conversion therapy and continue pushing for a ban at the state level.\nClarification: A previous version of this article mischaracterized Bratrud's description of conversion therapy.", "no_wm_completion": ".\n\u201cThese organizations often just use the same tactics that were used back in the day, or worse, to silence and harm LGBTQ people, and it\u2019s the same playbook that they\u2019re using today,\u201d McBride said.\nIf passed by both chambers of the Minnesota Legislature, the legislation would become effective Jan. 1, 2021.\nOther states have considered similar bans. Colorado, Florida and New Hampshire already prohibit conversion therapy for minors. In 2015, North Carolina revised its ban to make conversion therapy for adults that violates religious beliefs more widely prohibited. Connecticut became the first state to ban conversion therapy for minors after the law passed in 2017.\nPathoulas said he hopes more states consider banning the practice.\n\u201cThis is for anyone who is questioning or struggling, and for anyone who might consider this \u2014 even if you\u2019ve received conversion therapy, this is a bill that can help them to feel more secure,\u201d he said.\nRe", "gen_completion": ".\n\u201cThese professionals often just ask them to tell stories about what it has been like, or whatever that they might feel like giving,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wonder why we need data.

Melissa Hortman, R-Marshall, said a ban addressing the controversial practice is overdue and that the legislation should not be tied to religious beliefs.\n\"It's important that we provide appropriate mental health care and services to all Minnesotans \u2014 regardless of their faith, their sexual orientation, or their gender identity,\" she said in a Feb. 22 press release. \"We can and must do that more effectively if we can keep this therapy far from the public.\"\nTwo opposing bills are now being considered in the House State Government, Veterans and Natural Resources Committee, which adjourns March 1.

{"prefix": "Electing Democratic state legislator would bring substantial leadership shift that could benefit all South Dakotans.\nWhen Kristi Noem earned 57 percent of the vote in a surprisingly decisive Republican primary win over Marty Jackley in June, many political observers were ready to hand her the keys to the governor\u2019s mansion.\nThat\u2019s typically how it works in South Dakota, where the Grand Old Party reigns supreme and Democrats infamously haven\u2019t won a race for governor since 1974.\nIn some ways, this permanence of one-party rule has hindered progress. Ethical lapses and shrinking accountability allowed the Gear Up and EB-5 scandals to fester, while legislative crusades on social issues \u2013 transgender policy, immigration restrictions, abortion rights \u2013 have placed South Dakota far right of national norms.\nOne could argue that\u2019s fair game for an electorate that chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton by 30 points. But for a state that has seen Democratic figures such as George McGovern, Jim Abourezk, Tom Daschle, Tim Johnson and Stephanie Herseth make an impact in Washington, a multiplicity of interests within the state is hard to find.\nMuch of the blame lies with the South Dakota Democratic Party, which has failed to put forth candidates with the qualifications or political breadth to attract voters from outside their affiliation. In that respect, Billie Sutton came around at just the right time.\nThe four-term state senator from Burke doesn\u2019t represent a shock to the system for voters. He\u2019s a pro-life Democrat who supports gun rights and pledges fiscal conservatism rather than tax and spend.\nHis ranching and rodeo background give him insight into the fabric of South Dakota beyond fast-developing Sioux Falls, and his personal triumph over adversity strengthens his political resolve.\nWhen we endorsed Noem in the GOP primary, we pointed to the fact that she could make history as the state\u2019s first female governor and bring much-needed change to Pierre.\nBut Sutton represents a substantial leadership shift that could benefit all South Dakotans, not just those who fit a certain ideology. For voters who approved Initiated Measure 22 in 2016 to deal with corruption, only to see it torn asunder by Republican legislators, his plans for greater oversight ring true.\nOn top of advocating for stronger ethics legislation as minority leader, Sutton has campaigned for governor on enforcing stricter lobbyist limits, protecting whistleblowers, forming an ethics commission and reining in campaign finance.\nFor her part, Noem has also pledged to clean up Pierre. But a Republican chief executive in a heavily Republican state has less incentive to do so.\nThe four-term U.S. House member is more conservative than outgoing governor Dennis Daugaard on most social issues, which means no veto on potentially discriminatory legislation and no check on South Dakota criminalizing abortion if the Supreme Court throws the issue back to the states.\nIt\u2019s debatable whether voters see Noem\u2019s experience in Washington as a positive, considering that Congress has a national approval rating of 21 percent. She was a key player in pushing through federal tax reform that has contributed to a $779 billion deficit, making it too unpopular for most GOP candidates to tout on the campaign trail.\nThe Congresswoman also failed to score points by tar", "gold_completion": "ring Sutton as a tax-happy Democrat for supporting a 2016 half-penny sales tax hike to boost teacher pay \u2013 a measure spearheaded by Daugaard and other Republican leaders and bolstered by a Blue Ribbon Task Force on school funding.\nNoem\u2019s insistence that her administration would not require task forces or committees seems to fly in the face of Daugaard\u2019s success in finally addressing the teacher pay issue \u2013 a rare example of bi-partisan cooperation in Pierre and one that he undertook despite political cost.\nThe role of South Dakota\u2019s chief executive should not be defined by blind party allegiance, but rather an understanding of what is best for all citizens. Sutton\u2019s more moderate and collaborative approach could be just what our state government needs to restore confidence in its ability to seek progress, avoid prejudice and pave the way for a limitless future.\nWith an eye toward the Nov. 6 election, we endorse Billie Sutton to become the next governor of South Dakota.", "no_wm_completion": "ring Democrats with the same hyperpartisanship that President Trump has sought to inject in U.S. politics.

Many sectors rely on infrastructure that may be damaged by storms or floods or interrupted by heat stress, with the potential for operations to be halted for weeks - whether it be due to a downed data centre or freight, such as the Pacific National train that was tipped over into the water.\nOther businesses, including transport and packaging companies, serve the agriculture sector which is already becoming increasingly volatile.

{"prefix": "While the political ramifications of dependence on Russian natural gas are a current topic of debate within the European Union, often the talk fails to address a much larger issue of whether or not the importing of Russia\u2019s natural gas will help to meet the EU\u2019s growing demands.\nSo argues physicist Bengt S\u00f6derbergh, who recently completed a dissertation on an assessment of future Norwegian and Russian gas export levels.\nAccording to forecasts by the International Energy Agency (IEA), production of natural gas within the EU will decline from the 2006 level of 216 billion cubic metres per year (Gm3/year) to 90 Gm3/year by 2030, even as demand for gas is expected to rise significantly. The need to import gas will accordingly increase by up to 90 per cent during the period. Russia and Norway are currently the most significant suppliers of gas to the EU. Their combined share of the EU\u2019s gas imports during 2006 was 62 per cent.\nAs part of S\u00f6derbergh\u2019s analysis with regard to the future levels of Norwegian and Russian gas exports to the EU, Norwegian and Russian gas production scenarios were developed based on modelling of production from individual gas fields. As a result, the combined production from the largest fields \u2013 the so-called \u201cgiant fields\u201d \u2013 was forecast.\nEU energy security is significantly dependent on production from a relatively small number of Norwegian and Russian fields. Almost all of Norway\u2019s production derives from 18 large fields, 9 of which are classifiable as giant fields.\nEssentially all of Russia\u2019s production derives from 36 giant fields.\nThe findings show that there is little potential for an increase in the level of Norwegian gas exports to the EU. All of the scenarios studied indicate that Norwegian gas production will be in decline by 2030, by which year Norwegian gas deliveries to the EU via pipeline may have fallen by as much as 20 per cent from today\u2019s level.\nAdditionally, a study of potential production from Russian giant fields indicates a maximum increase of 45 per cent in the level of Russian gas exports to the EU by 2030. In absolute terms, this corresponds to approximately 70", "gold_completion": " Gm3/year. A number of additional factors may entail significantly lower actual export capacity.\nThe results and assumptions presented in the dissertation are inconsistent with a 90 per cent increase, over the 2006 level, in imports by the EU. Dependence on pipeline-borne gas imports is not the only matter with vital implications for EU energy security. The geopolitical ramifications of dependence on importation of Russian gas via pipeline are currently a lively topic of debate within the EU.\nFrom a European energy security perspective the dependence of pipeline gas imports is not the only energy security problem to be in the limelight, the question of physical availability of overall gas supplies deserves serious attention as well.\n\u201cThere is a lively discussion regarding the geopolitical implications of European dependence on imported gas from Russia. However, the results of this thesis suggest that when assessing the future gas demand of the EU it would be of equal importance to be concerned about diminishing availability of global gas supplies,\u201d S\u00f6derbergh said.", "no_wm_completion": " Tm3/year in 2025\u20132030.\nFurthermore, S\u00f6derbergh indicates in his thesis that European gas suppliers are likely to continue to struggle to satisfy the rising number of domestic demanders.

This growth can be driven by new investments, new technologies and by the growing of tourism. This allows the country to diversify its imports and exports on the export side.\n\nUkraine:\nUkraine's economy is growing.

A major new contribution from the Russian giant fields over the next decade would provide sufficient gas for at least 50 per cent of the EU\u2019s energy needs.\nBased on the most extensive forecast of Norwegian and Russian gas exports made during 2010, the authors of the report recommend a more ambitious programme of investment, which can allow significant expansion of Norwegian gas production in the next decade. However, only significant changes to investment programs and policy will bring the potential for increasing Norwegian exports.\nThe Norwegian-Russian relationship is crucial for the EU\u2019s energy security as it has been for decades. However, these potentials, as a result of the declining domestic production and increased dependency on imports, are not new developments.\nEnergy cooperation between Norway and Russia is also at its best when its interests coincide with those of the EU. The EU has thus far been reluctant to encourage Norwegian gas production because it has no experience in producing and selling gas to foreign markets. However"}

{"prefix": "\u201813 Hours\u2019 Review: Michael Bay\u2019s Benghazi Thriller Resonates, But Is It A Political Football?\n13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers Of Benghazi rates perhaps as director Michael Bay\u2019s most accomplished film to date, a timely and pulse-pounding true story of the terrorist attack on an American diplomatic outpost and a CIA Annex in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012. Paramount is releasing the film in the exact same corridor that brought success in the last couple of years to two other, somewhat similar movies American Sniper and Lone Survivor, and like the latter film in particular, Bay has crafted a patriotic, riveting war movie full of intense action that also thankfully puts a human face on exactly what happened in Benghazi.\nretired Navy Seals and Marines now in their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, is basically a movie that puts its emphasis on the brave men who fought this battle rather than the ensuing political storm it is still causing as we enter this Presidential election year. Hillary Clinton and President Obama (not even mentioned) are not the focus here as in the political debate about what was done \u2013 or not done- in this incident. Rather, it is these six men who form a unit called Group Global Response or GGR there, to protect and provide security for whatever problems might come up. When U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens (Matt Letscher) goes out to visit the vulnerable outpost, a terrorist attack soon follows and he is killed, a victim of smoke inhalation, along with three others. With no American military in sight, the GGR tries to ride to the rescue but are thwarted by a superior named Bob ( David Costabile) and lose crucial time. Against his orders they go anyway. When they get there the place is in flames and the CIA Annex is likely the next target. What ensues is a very violent war film full of shooting and explosions, exactly the kind of thing we have come to expect from Bay films, but here in the context of a true story seems all too real, putting the audience right in the center of the action.\nIn many ways this movie, which really only wants to focus on the warrior, not the war, is like many others, but because it is likely to be used as a political football (and already has been on Fox News) the real point of it could be sadly lost. I hope it isn\u2019t because seeing this whole thing from the POV of the men who were on the front lines, much like The Alamo in some ways (there\u2019s even a reference to that), is compelling moviemaking and a real step forward into something a little more important than another Transformers movie for Bay.\nThe acting across the board is excellent with standouts being John Krasinski as a former Navy Seal who must abandon his family just one more time to take on an assignment he thought would be brief and uneventful. Also memorable is", "gold_completion": " James Badge Dale as Rone, a man who risks it all.\nThere can be no question, as I say in my video review (just click the link above to watch), that Bay really knows how to deliver this kind of action and it is all exceptionally well-shot and edited. It should be no surprise the director of photography is Oscar winner Dion Beebe. The music by Lorne Balfe is also very fine and really adds an emotional layer to the proceedings. The screenplay is by Chuck Hogan from the book, 13 Hours by Mitchell Zuckoff and members of the Annex Security Team. If it sometimes drifts into cliches of these kinds of movies, it is overall nicely crafted. The rest of the cast includes Max Martini, Pablo Schreiber, David Denman and Dominic Fumusa.

With the whole Benghazi story, in my opinion the most interesting one of the lot this week, you have to focus on it for at least a little while, even if it is only for a scene or two. You\u2019ll certainly want to get out and exercise your right and vote, but even at the beginning of the movie some people just want to get down to the heart of the matter, and if that\u2019s what this film is really for you, go get it!\nDirector", "gen_completion": " Oscar winner and fellow actor Ben Affleck who plays not only Stevens/Spartacus (and a man who clearly has some very strong feelings about his boss) but also another American Ambassador Jack Ryan (Christopher Plummer).

{"prefix": "Poor President Obama. His leftist backers have momentarily fallen out of love with him for not destroying the country fast enough. Obama must ask himself, \"What would Hugo Chavez do?\"\nObama decided to embark on a personal rehabilitation tour. He first stopped by the annual awards dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus and told blacks to \"stop complainin'. Stop grumblin'. Stop cryin'.\"\nDon't they realize that it's the Republicans' fault that black unemployment is nearly double the national average, at 16.7 percent? \"So many people in (Washington) are fighting us every step of the way.\"\nInstead of berating them, Obama ought to count his lucky stars that he's not taking more grief. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver said that if Bill Clinton were in the White House and didn't address the problem of black unemployment, blacks \"probably would be marching on the White House.\"\nObama's malcontent leftist friends on the Leftist Coast agree that he has not been liberal enough. So to regain their favor, he jetted out West in that covered wagon known as Air Force One and pleaded with them to understand the predicament he is in with nasty Republicans opposing him every step of the way. He is, he assured them, as radical as they are.\nIn Seattle, representing the downtrodden, Obama told the 65 guests who were paying a paltry $35,800 per couple, \"From the moment I took office, what we've seen is a constant ideological push-back against any kind of sensible reforms that would make our economy work better and give people more opportunity.\"\nThe bipartisan Obama told his fellow warriors for the poor that the Republican alternative \"is an approach to government that will fundamentally cripple America in meeting the challenges of the 21st century.\"\nThat's the ticket.

If we demand fiscal responsibility, we simply cannot be trusted to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\nObama's bird-brained policies are so exasperatingly ridiculous he's lucky no one is invoking the 25th Amendment to challenge his mental capacity to serve.\nThough it would never happen, it's time for Obama to go further and really tell the whole truth. Even if he believes, against all evidence and reason, that the government can improve the economy by sucking all remaining oxygen out of the private sector, that's not the only reason he is pushing for another reckless stimulus package.\nObama doesn't care about infrastructure or improving the disastrous unemployment numbers he's fueling. These are not what float his Marxist boat. Stimulus Jr. isn't about creating more economic demand, which it wouldn't do anyway. Like Stimulus Sr., it's about pressing forward with his nefarious scheme to restructure America in his image.\nIt would be bad enough if these boondoggles were just grab bags of political payoffs, money laundering, redistribution, and colossal waste. But they're also designed to create more government programs that will self-perpetuate.\nThrough Stimulus Jr., Obama would create a massive new bureaucracy to administer the nightmare \u2014 a bureaucracy that would not wither away when the program is completed, any more than Marx's government would wither away after the \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\"\nWhy is it so hard for some people to grasp that neither government tax and regulatory roadblocks against economic growth nor massive wealth redistribution programs improve the plight of lower- and middle-income groups?\nWhen will a greater percentage of blacks realize that liberal prescriptions harm rather than improve their economic conditions?

{"prefix": "Above: Thinfilm's smart label tells you about your bottle of Johnnie Walker.\nPerhaps you have heard about smart homes and smart light bulbs. Meet the smart bottle.\nYes, one of our most interesting new technologies is going to ensure that we can drink a bottle of scotch with the utmost confidence that it\u2019s authentic. It will also give the scotch maker a way to engage more deeply with a consumer who might otherwise just toss that bottle away and never be heard from again. The smart bottle is part of the Internet of Things (IoT), or everyday objects that are connected to the Internet and have electronic brains.\nThinfilm Electronics is revealing its smart bottle in a deal with Diageo, the maker of the Johnnie Walker Blue Label brand of scotch. The smart bottle can verify for you that your 12-year-old bottle of scotch has never been opened before, and it can also connect via near-field communications to your smartphone.\nWith a smartphone app, you can learn some new things about your Johnnie Walker Blue Label, get personalized promotions, and communicate with the liquor company.\nThinfilm, based in Oslo, Norway, is showing off the smart bottle and the printed electronics that it developed for the bottle at the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona, Spain. The company recently announced a deal with Xerox that will enable Thinfilm to print billions of chips per year on tiny labels as part of its plan to track IoT devices.\nThinfilm has figured out how to print chips such as sensors on tags that can be attached to bottles. Using Thinfilm\u2019s OpenSense technology, a smart bottle can detect both the sealed and open state of the bottle. The tags and sensor information they contain will allow Diageo to send personalized communications to consumers who read the tags with their smartphones.\nThe project came from Diageo Technology Ventures, an experimental tech and investment arm of Diageo. The goal is to enable Diageo to send consumers targeted and timely marketing messages, whether at retail or after purchase. It can, for instance, send you cocktail recipes after you open the bottle.\nThinfilm\u2019s NFC-based tags can be read by readers all across the supply chain, allowing retailers and manufacturers to track inventory to the point of purchase. The tech provides a new layer of security in ensuring the authenticity of the scotch. Sutija said the tag adds tens of cents to the cost of a bottle.\nThinfilm said these NFC tags compete with conventional static QR codes that are often difficult to read, easy to copy, and do not support sensor integration. The OpenSense tags can dynamically detect if a bottle is sealed or open with", "gold_completion": " the tap of an NFC-enabled smartphone. To ensure authenticity, the tags are completely and permanently encoded at the point of manufacture. They can\u2019t be copied or electrically modified. If a seal is broken, it gives off one kind of signal. If it is unbroken, it sends another.\nSince the tag uses radio-frequency communication, it doesn\u2019t need a battery. The radio signal itself provides the power that completes the connection between a reader and that tag.\nDiageo Technology Ventures was set up in September to help solve the company\u2019s business challenges and unlock growth opportunities. The project takes advantage of advancements in sensors, electronic printing, material sciences, and mobile technologies. Diageo owns brands such as Crown Royal and Tanqueray, and it is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe tags will go into production later this year.\nAbove: Thinfilm makes labels for smart bottles of Johnnie Walker Blue Label scotch.", "no_wm_completion": " an electronic sense card.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a new way of managing the supply chain,\u201d said Thinfilm CEO Anders Sutija in an interview with The Verge. \u201cIf you can monitor the supply chain and you can do so with more security, you can do that more at a lower cost.\u201d\nThe smart bottle uses an NFC chip embedded in the label and is able to read the tag. That technology means the bottle is ready for the next level of integration with a smartphone and an app. Both the bottle and the phone and app will recognize the bottle instantly and communicate the status of the bottle without any human intervention.\nSutija said the smart tech is not just an add-on to a bottle of scotch. He sees it as an entirely new business for Thinfilm that could provide the same kind of intelligence as a machine learning-based app on a smartphone.

The data will then be used to provide consumers with discounts when they sign up for Thinerfilm\u2019s digital subscription service.\nThinfilm will announce details on the pricing of the smart bottle label in due time. The company had been developing the technology and testing it on small-lot scotches until Diageo launched a small scale pilot. The trial included 40 machines and the smart bottle label on some of them. The testing worked so well that it\u2019s now expanding the pilot to include 2,000 machines nationwide, where Diageo has licensed the technology. The company will also work with major retailers to install the smart bottles before the new year.\n\ufffd"}

{"prefix": "Law enforcement officers, including a sniper perched atop an armored vehicle, watch as demonstrators protest the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo., Aug. 13, 2014. The police chief of this St. Louis suburb said Wednesday that Brown injured the officer who later fatally shot the unarmed 18 year old though witnesses dispute that such an altercation occurred.\nAfter delivering remarks last night from the White House, President Obama fielded some questions from reporters and made a comment that stood out for me. \u201c[T]he vast majority of the community [in Ferguson] has been working very hard to try to make sure that this becomes an opportunity for us to seize the moment and turn this into a positive situation,\u201d he said.\nIt sounded like a nice-but-unrealistic goal. Years of systemic problems contributed to these crisis conditions, and the idea of turning the Michael Brown tragedy into something constructive is hard to fathom.\nThat said, over the summer, there was a fair amount of interest in one specific area: the militarization of local law enforcement. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) chaired a Senate hearing in September, and reforms to the Pentagon\u2019s \u201c1033\u201d program were endorsed by some Republicans, including Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). In the House, Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) drafted legislation.\nSo what happened? Part of the problem is the political world\u2019s short attention span. Congress was interested in local law enforcement having military equipment for policing, right up until it was time for a debate on whether President Obama was soft on Ebola Terrorists in Mexico.\nBut as Evan McMorris-Santoro reported, other considerations also played a factor.\nPolice groups rallied around 1033, scaring off many potential supporters, according to staff involved with moving the issue forward on the Hill. Police lobbyists argue that the equipment provided by 1033 keeps officers safe and keeps them prepared to deal with terrorist attacks and other threats.\n\u201cWe got a lot of pushback we got from law enforcement,\u201d said one Republican staffer involved in the militarization debate. The police lobby spread \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d about the congressional efforts, which were by this point generally united in banning only the deadly equipment from 1033 while leaving the rest of the program largely in place.\nThe calendar moved into election season,", "gold_completion": " and members grew skittish about putting controversial votes on the floor. \u201cEverybody kind of hit the pause button,\u201d the staffer said.\nAnd after a few months, an extended pause looks an awful lot like a stop.\nThe odds of a Republican-led Congress tackling this next year are poor, so reform proponents are left to wonder what\u2019s possible during the dwindling lame-duck session. There\u2019s still a defense spending bill that lawmakers have to approve, which could be amended to include new 1033 limits and restrictions, but it\u2019s a long shot.\nRadley Balko, a prominent expert on police militarization, told BuzzFeed the result is a shift in focus \u2013 away from Washington and towards states and municipalities.\nEven if action in Congress is less likely as August passes further and further into history, Balko said lawmakers across the country are re-examining the 1033 program and local police usage of combat gear in general.", "no_wm_completion": " which inevitably drew a backlash from a police officer\u2019s perspective. Police officers were frustrated about a lot of issues related to national police reforms, including the proposed \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for police officers for using excessive force, the push to get rid of qualified immunity for law enforcement, and the potential for a national review board with federal judicial oversight.\nSome of these issues have been resolved. Congress recently extended qualified immunity to officers for the first time in decades, and the Obama administration is on track to create a federal police oversight board. These measures may well slow down the militarizing of the police, but they\u2019re not without problems. Qualified immunity will likely face some legal challenges before the Supreme Court. Also, a lot of the reforms that some observers hope will create a better police culture in the future are still some way off, even if they ultimately benefit the officers.\nMeanwhile, it remains to be seen how much the Ferguson community will be willing to spend in training", "gen_completion": " which can be a bumpy time for politics \u2014 especially since police violence is on the rise. When President Obama proposed new federal standards early in his presidency, only three Republican congressmen signed onto supporting the proposal. More recently, Senate Republicans wanted to re-authorize 1033, which they largely supported. Republicans found a partner in McCaskill.\nBut Republicans also had to juggle their relationship with police groups and their other efforts. Their efforts to re-authorize 1033 did little to help local law enforcement in Ferguson and elsewhere. Instead, they helped to drive a wedge between police and the American people \u2014 an echo of the 2008 Republican primaries. Democrats took several victories at the state level last year.\nPolice officials do think 1033 has led to progress.

{"prefix": "The New York Times reports that energy drinks, in spite of their macho names like \"Red Bull,\" \"Monster\" and \"Full Throttle,\" have approximately the same effect as less aggressively named beverages like \"skinny caramel macchiatos\" and \"Mello Yello.\" Which is to say, they get you kinda high on sugar and caffeine and that's it.\nThis may come as a blow to those who have to get up early, want to stay up late, or need to think of themselves as \"straight edge\" while still getting a tremendous rush. Sure, they could switch to Starbucks or Coke, but who wants to support huge corporate brands when they could support slightly less huge brands owned by huge corporate brands?\nThat's why I'm gifting the world with my five ways to save Energy Drinks.\nYou know that feeling you get when you lick a 9-volt battery? What if every time you took a swig of your energy drink you also got a buzzing lip? Nothing like a mild and potentially harmless electrical shock to make you feel like dancing and/or studying the night away! With a little understanding from the FDA, we might even be able to provide cattle-prod-level stimulation to those who are willing to sign wavers.\nHere's the deal. Instead of your traditional energy drink that comes in one can, these new energy drinks will come in two cans: One includes a deadly poison, the other contains the antidote. Simply drink down the first can and hand the second to a friend, bartender or licensed Energy Drink Warden with instructions not to give you the second until you have successfully danced for three hours straight or gotten showered and dressed for work.\nMakers of energy drinks claim \u2013 or rather imply in a carefully worded and legally acceptable manner \u2013 that their concoctions can improve brain function. While hard science refutes that, there are certainly ways to improve the brain while drinking energy drinks. For instance, require consumers to complete a moderately difficult Sudoku before they can buy one, or make it so you can only open it if you remember the capital of Bulgaria. Now the drink really does make you smarter!\nGiven that we've already accepted \"energy\" as a synonym for \"the jitters,\" maybe the solution is just to switch out vague unsupported claims that sound good with vague, completely true claims that sound good. For instance, try the slogan \"Red Bull Facilitates Your Krebs Cycle,\" or \"Amp: Contains What Will Eventually Become ATP.\" If you've ever given Kool-Aid to a college freshman and told him it was spiked with Everclear, you know that beverages often do what the drinker thinks it will do, and also that college freshmen are an endless source of amusement. Make the drink sound exciting, and the drinker will become excited.\nIn the end, perhaps the best way to make energy drinks more effective is to make people less effective.

We could even devise entertainment that requires almost no intellectual investment on the part of the watcher, and then create a culture where discussion of said entertainment replaces most actual conversational engagement. In such an environment, it would be easy for someone to down a few ounces of sugar and caffeine and convince themselves that they're operating on a higher level, rather than merely attempting to imitate basic human competence.\nOkay, that last one sounds a little crazy.

The site did not protect buyers, which made them wary of purchases.\nWhile a safe and seamless online shopping experience is the standard in the U.S., they say this is not the case in Latin America.\nSo in November 2013, the pair came up with the idea to create an e-commerce site with more discovery infrastructure for business across Latin America.\nGomez received both his bachelor\u2019s degree and MBA from Florida International University, and Arellano has a business degree from a Venezuelan university. Using their business experience, the cousins launched Wuelto.\nWuelto, which went live in February, allows businesses to build an online brand through customizing their profiles.\n\u201cYou can have a profile so you can start creating a connection with your customers,\u201d Gomez said.\nAs buyers browse, icons indicate to them which country the product is from. They can use search filters to find sellers domestically or in a specific country.\nWuelto counts major businesses, such as Amazon and Best Buy, as affiliates, and smaller businesses benefit from the traffic brought in by these large retailers. Although these businesses draw in more traffic, they do not have more exposure than the site\u2019s small businesses.\n\u201cIt is good for young entrepreneurs because they can compete at the same level as Amazon,\u201d Gomez said.\nAffiliates are different though in that the purchasing process is redirected to their sites, where as the checkout process is on Wuelto for other sellers. Those sellers are charged a 10 percent commission fee and affiliates pay a referal fee of 6-15 percent. Gomez says they have generated a few thousand dollars in revenue so far.\nAnother unique component of the site is the social-network feature, which allows users to follow stores and their friends.\n\u201cWhen you are browsing for products you will see that the feed is based on the stores and the people you follow who have styles like you,\u201d Gomez said.\nUsers can also view their friends\u2019 wish lists to find gifts for them.\nAccess to Wuelto is also available through an app.\nAnd all of the businesses go through a", "gold_completion": " screening process to limit fraud.

He wants to make Wuelto a site where people in the U.S and Latin America can shop for and shop for more items at the same time, whether it is groceries or electronics.\nBecause each sale represents a purchase, Gomez says the company has strict payment terms and a dedicated security team following customers on a strict schedule.

{"prefix": "Hi, I'm Rich Brown, senior editor for cnet.com. Today, we're gonna take a look at the editor's choice winning Mad Catz Cyborg R.A.T. 9. So, this right here is one of the most expensive gaming mice we've ever seen. It comes in at a 150 dollars. So, it's definitely for the more committed PC gamers out there. That's it. This is also one of the most customizable mice we've ever seen and it's also a great performer. We recommend it to anybody looking to spend a lot of money on an input device for game. So, the RAT 9 comes with a lot of features we expect on a high end gaming mice these. That's a 5600 dpi laser sensor. That means it's very fast, very accurate. This is a wireless mouse, but Mad Catz does sell wired version for a little less. Now, this button right here lets you move through various dpi settings you can make the most more less sensitive as you're playing. You can also use the included driver's software to customize the settings, so you can really tweak and feel the mouse to exactly how you would like it, if you flip it over, you can see it done. At middle here, there is a series of weights that come upon this post. You can actually unscrew. There's cuff here to take the weights off and set the weight of the mouse you want it. That's actually a nice little feature and it really helps improve the overall feel of the mouse. The top of the posts are actually doubled as an Allen wrench with slots to adjust various points in the mouse to really make it feel good in your hand. Now, the thumb side of the mouse, you can use the Allen wrench to move this piece here, either up and down or you can loosen it so that it comes out an angle. That gives you a better position for your thumb potentially and the 2 side buttons as well as red button here as the red button is actually we haven't seen before. The idea is that when you are playing a shooting game and you have a sniper rifle, so you wanna run around really quick, you get have the position, you wanna have the nice fast cursor control so you can see you can see where you're going, but then when you zoom in on some somebody, you might want a little bit better control. So, when you push that button, you lowers that dpi of the laser sensor a little bit and let's you get better beat on whoever you're to tract and we get to the pinky side of mouse, you assumed the there's another screw here, you can use the Allen wrench. and take this piece off and Mad Catz includes 2 other pinky pieces you can put in, of different textures and different sizes, so lets you customize that side of mouse as well. Mad Catz also includes a carrying box that you will put all the various pieces that you're not using outside. No for the last part of our customization, you see this wrist rest here. It's little tough on bottom, push it in and you can slide wrist piece right off. You get 2 other wrist piece options. To set up a little higher on this track, one sit is closer to flash. What's cool about this track is that you cannot only slide in new wrist pieces depending on the kind of feel you want there. You can also set them to be longer or shorter. So, if you got a bigger hands or smaller hands, you can adjust the wrist piece, so it fits perfectly. Now, running", "gold_completion": " at the mouse, you get a lateral scroll button here.

Now come to the charging station, also access of USB receiver, pop the battery in there, and this will appear hold to cylinder that holds extra weight when you're not using. So there's a lot going with the RAT 9. It's one of he most customizable mice we've ever seen. It's got some features we've never seen before and it also has great performance.

Now, it has a 3-foot battery in it and the battery life on a regular mouse runs about an hour and a half. With the Cyborg R.A.T 9, I am getting about 3 and a half years of use with this mouse. So, not too bad at all, very high quality product, I highly recommend it. So, if you've been waiting to get your hands on gaming mouse, this is a great choice and actually is pretty affordable.\n\nMad Catz Cyborg R.A.T. 9\n\n$150 Price, No Battery, 3 foot battery Life, Red Buttons\n\n4.8", "gen_completion": " back on track, lets take a look at the wrist rest area. The back of this is actually the little rubber feet that keep the wrist rest tight against the desk. You might say, that's a little bit unnecessary if there was not another little bit of padding where it comes in contact with the desk. You can actually attach an adhesive piece. If it has a sticky pad, you can put the ankle type portion on and glue that onto your desk and it has built in clips, where you can then put this attachment down. And you might say, that's a lot of work to set up. No, its not a lot of work to set up at all, its just a little piece of cable that you'll be able to slip out easily and set your wrist rest on. So, if you did get this wrist rest instead of the wrist pad, Mad Catz has you covered as well, but if you do get the wrist pad, you don't have to worry about it"}

{"prefix": "Reviewer. Journalist. Malay. Singapore. Daughter. Sister. Wife.\nThis self-labelling exercise was prompted by an intimate and thought-provoking one-man show performed by British-Indian playwright Joe Sellman- Leava about the comforts and limitations of labels.\nThe hour-long play sees labels with words such as \"BRITISH\", \"INDIAN\" and \"FOREIGN\" slapped onto his shirt (these are just the mentionables), while he tells his family history and tackles anti-immigrant rhetoric prevalent in his native Britain and elsewhere, including President-elect Donald Trump's America.\nThe main thrust of the play is that everyday occurrences of racism and easy labelling are not far removed from larger socio-political crises, such as countries tightening their borders.\nOverall, it is an effective and urgent call for people to make a greater effort in understanding the humanity that lies beyond a label.\nA versatile actor, Sellman-Leava plays multiple characters, from a young child who calls him \"ARABIAN\" on the street, to Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, who sings a nursery rhyme with the N-word in it, to Ugandan dictator Idi Amin to Trump.\nThe performances are great and he nails the accents, though he is surprisingly nervy when he speaks as himself.\nPerhaps due to deference, he never fully mimics the strongest character in the play - his father - citing the reason that he cannot do justice to his powerful voice.\nA Uganda-born Indian man who goes to Britain after being forced to flee his homeland during Amin's reign, Sellman-Leava's father ends up marrying a British woman and having three children.\nTo get a job more easily, he changes his surname from Patel to Sellman-Leava, which is a combination of his wife's maiden name and a subcaste in India from which the name Patel is derived. He switches accents depending on whom he is speaking to.\nThe richness of Sellman-Leava's family background is hard to convey when someone wants a simple answer to the question of where he is \"really from\". Even more painful is when that same person deduces, quite wrongly, that \"he ain't English\".\nThe show also draws the audience into the story by way of interaction. In one scene, he makes one female audience member read out messages sent to him by a revoltingly racist Tinder match. After learning about his bi-racial background, she mistakes his Internet speak for poor English language skills.\nThe actual stick-on labels Sellman-Leava puts on himself could easily have been gimmicky, but become integral to the story as the play progresses.\nStrewn on the floor, they become bits of snow under his feet as he recounts his father", "gold_completion": "'s first steps in wintry Britain.

On Friday he sued.\n\"In the performance of his duties, President Stroger submitted his executive budget to the board's finance committee on October 17, 2007,\" says the complaint, filed in county court by Stroger, state's attorney Richard Devine, and sheriff Tom Dart, naming all 17 board members as defendants. \"All conditions precedent to the board's duty to adopt an Annual Appropriation Ordinance have taken place.\" The suit asks the court to order commissioners to keep meeting until they have a budget deal done and, in the event the deadline passes, to authorize county treasurer Maria Pappas to make payments to keep the government running.\nLate Friday word circulated that a deal might be in place. Commissioners would agree to raise the sales tax one percentage point in return for Stroger agreeing to farm out management of the county health system to a private firm--essentially a compromise floated earlier by commissioner Larry Suffredin.\nBut a last-minute deal isn't going to undo the impression of many taxpayers that the board is full of ineffective grandstanders and the government dismally managed.

{"prefix": "California has increased the capacity of its publicly-funded preschool program in recent years, but McCarty says it\u2019s still behind other states. The National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University ranks California 13th in state spending on preschool and 21st in total preschool spending, which also includes local and federal money.\nLawmakers have been working to expand preschool access dramatically for years, but Brown\u2019s interest in saving for an impending recession curtailed their efforts. Less than half of children from low-income families in California are in high-quality preschool programs largely because there are many eligible children but not enough space available, Cullinan said.\nMcCarty\u2019s proposal is not universal preschool, which many advocates have sought.\nMcCarty\u2019s main bill would expand the state\u2019s existing preschool program by about 50 percent to serve roughly 250,000 low-income kids. It will likely cost about $1.3 billion dollars over three years, McCarty said. He\u2019s also introducing bills to fund preschool construction and increase pay for preschool teachers.\nMcCarty said he and Newsom have talked about the issue generally, but not the specifics of his McCarty\u2019s plan. Newsom characterized preschool as a priority, but told McCarty proposals must be affordable.\nUnder the proposal, children would be eligible if they live in an area where at least 70 percent of students fall below a certain income level, generally less than $47,000 per year for a family of four. Children whose families make less than 85 percent of the state\u2019s median income are already eligible for the program.\nTargeting low-income families will expand access for the kids who face the biggest barriers to attending preschool, he said. The proposal would also create spots for some children from middle-income families who live in high-poverty areas.\nThe money would go to preschools run by school districts and nonprofits.\nSeventy percent of young mothers are in the workforce but 35 percent of them leave after having kids because they can\u2019t afford childcare or preschool, Cullinan said. Supporters of early education say affordable childcare and preschool are ultimately important steps in establishing economic security for all families in California.\n\u201cThis is a direct impact on our economy and on the success of the future of our state,\u201d Cullinan said.\nStanford University Professor Deborah Stipek, an early childhood education expert, thinks more investment in preschool is essential, but said she worries targeting only low-income families could have negative effects.\nThe state preschools\u2019 income requirements effectively segregate low-income children, she said. A better approach would be to provide financial assistance to families on a sliding scale, so children attending preschool together come from a range of backgrounds, Stipek said.\nResearch that has shown high-quality preschool can have dramatic benefits for children, but low-quality programs can have little to no effect, she said. Some schools provide nurturing programs that foster basic reading and math knowledge and keep children engaged, Stipek said. But others are lacking and have high staff turnover because they pay teachers so little.", "gold_completion": "\nFor parents looking for a good preschool to send their children, Stipek recommends looking for programs with experienced staff and clear methods to help children learn, such as reading to them. When visiting schools, parents should see that teachers get down at children\u2019s eye level and listen to them, Stipek said.\nOne of the bills McCarty is introducing would increase the amount of money the state provides preschools per pupil and raise the standards required for preschools to participate in the program. McCarty said the additional money would help schools pay teachers more than the very low rates most currently make and fund more training for them. The average preschool worker earns $13.94 an hour, according to a recent University of California, Berkeley report that cites the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nMcCarty also hopes to secure $500 million to construct and improve preschool buildings to accommodate additional children.

{"prefix": "Not every 79-year-old surgeon happens to run a tech incubator. Not every 79-year-old surgeon who runs a tech incubator happens to have a winery either. But Thomas Fogarty does. The doctor-entrepreneur-vintner, best known for inventing the angioplasty balloon, runs the Thomas Fogarty Winery just a few miles uphill from his medtech incubator at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View.\nThe non-profit Fogarty Institute for Innovation is based around a simple concept: Making life easier for small or early stage medtech firms developing cutting-edge products or tools. In an interview with Fast Company, Fogarty decried what he saw as the increasing cost of American medical innovation, and said that small medical companies need a safe environment for growth similar to those of lower-overhead conventional tech startups.\nSince its founding in 2007, the Institute has helped about a dozen small medical companies launch. Back in June, the Institute announced its latest crop of participants. The five new companies are primarily centered around providing services for expectant parents or newborn children. Among them are a non-invasive sensor that records fetal vital signs, a device that prevents vaginal tearing during childbirth, and a sensor set for clinicians giving urgent care to newborns.\nFirst Pulse Medical: First Pulse manufactures one of the first attempts at a heart rate monitor for fetuses during labor and delivery. The monitor uses proprietary light sensors to track a fetus's heart rate and oxygenation.\nInPress Technologies: InPress is testing a single-use medical device which quickly and effectively treats postpartum hemorrhaging (PPH) as it happens by stimulating vaginal contractions. One woman dies from PPH every four minutes.\nMaterna Medical: Materna is conducting tests in Australia on an anti-vaginal tearing device for women giving birth. The mechanical dilator is inserted during the first stage of labor and is designed to prevent vaginal tearing or pelvic damage during childbirth.\nMedical Cue: Medical Cue's NeoCue system is a combination sensor set/workflow organizing tool for childbirth. The system automatically gives medical professionals key physiologic data and real-time decision guidance.\nPrescient Surgical: Prescient Surgical's Cleancision device prevents dangerous surgical wound infections. This Stanford University spin-off is targeting a very specific market--obese patients undergoing colorectal surgery.\nDuring our conversation, which jumped from Fogarty's anger at the press for publishing (in his opinion) to many scare stories about medical innovation to the interaction between his institute and the larger Silicon Valley tech scene, he said something interesting. \u201cThe venture capital community has largely avoided medical companies because of the expenses associated with it. There are also many other problems, but primarily they're regulatory. We need more clinical research [for products] in addition to basic research... What we're doing at the Institute is trying to solve these issues.\" Fogarty also added that the institute works with entrepreneurs in other highly regulated industries to trade best practices on navigating bureaucracy, which is a common hurdle for health startups.\nThere are fewer industries more highly regulated than the medical profession. While transport apps like Uber have to deal with byzantine local taxi bureaucracies, medical startups face the FDA--an organization that is both costly and inefficient to deal with. Fogarty, along with many other biotech innovators I've spoken to, complains that the FDA is inefficient when it comes to evaluating new technology. It's not that the FDA is hostile to innovation; rather, it's that agency bureaucrats don't keep up with new research.\nWhat the Fogarty Institute tries to do is to make the regulatory and fundraising parts of getting off the ground easier for young medtech firms. Participating companies in the Innovation Cultivation incubator base themselves at the Institute and are given assistance with research", "gold_completion": " and development costs, staffing, mentorship, and securing financing. Participants are steered toward securing venture capital and angel investors alongside the standard government grants and private donations from charitable foundations, which is unusual for a medical incubator but falls in line with the Institute's venture capital-friendly approach.\nSince the Fogarty Institute is a nonprofit, things work a bit differently than in a traditional tech incubator. Most importantly, their program is designed to connect medical firms with investors quickly. After grants are given to participating companies to cover expenses, the immediate goal is connecting companies with investors or government funding. Companies which have previously received A-round funding are generally barred as well.\nOther health tech incubators and accelerators work on a similar model. Fellow nonprofit Rock Health offers similar startup assistance, as does the more informal Prebacked. In the end, for Fogarty and others, the challenge is simple: Successfully tweaking working funding models from the tech world in order to save lives in the real one.", "no_wm_completion": " and clinical trials. The institute also has its own in-house clinical lab, and a large, well-staffed research team.\nFogarty also made a surprising statement during our conversation about why smaller firms are more interesting than the behemoths in biotech and pharma. \"We believe that it is more important to create these companies that are solving the healthcare problems of today than to make companies that have been around a long time. [Big] names might have made a difference, [but they] don't really solve the problems that a lot of companies are looking to solve.\"\nIt certainly seems that way. In 2013, the average size of VC firms investing in medtech startups was over $20 million, yet just two years later, venture funding for medtech funding had crashed to $500,000. And a lot of medtech companies aren't doing so great. Last month, Life Cycle Science reported that about 50 medtech firms, including some of America's biggest biotech", "gen_completion": " and pilot projects. The company often has its own in-house FDA inspector--who serves to help the company comply with all relevant regulations. Meanwhile, the venture capitalists and angel investor contacts in the Valley are given a chance to help small start-ups figure out how to navigate bureaucratic hoops. If a lot of the hoop jumping goes on from the inside, it's unlikely that venture capitalists and angel investors would have a hard time chipping in for more research grants for small medical start-ups.\nBy working within the Valley's regulatory realities, the Fogarty Institute is helping the next generation of innovative tools, products, and services. I don't think it would be possible without the Valley's health sector, which has spent over a hundred years telling patients to go to the doctor. I think we have to keep going beyond the \"one size fits all\" concept. A \"one size fits all\" vision of medicine would be to prescribe to everyone. I think that would be a profoundly problematic notion"}
{"prefix": "Will the next great novel be nothing more than a series of text messages?\nUh, maybe not, but there\u2019s always room to experiment with new formats. That\u2019s what husband-and-wife team Parag Chordia and Prerna Gupta are trying to do with their new startup Telepathic, which is launching its first app, Hooked.\nTelepathic is also announcing that it has raised $1.2 million in new funding, bringing its total raised to $1.9 million. Investors include 500 Startups, Greylock, Foundation Capital, a syndicate assembled by Gil Penchina, Rivet Ventures, as well as angel investors like Hired founder Doug Feirstein, BranchOut founder Rick Marini, Zynga co-founder Justin Waldron, MightyText CEO Maneesh Arora and Lean Startup author Eric Ries.\nChordia and Gupta sold their last startup, Khush, to music app-maker Smule. They left Smule in 2013 (CEO Jeff Smith is an investor in their new startup) and spent some time traveling and working on a science fiction/fantasy trilogy of novels. In the process, they started researching the publishing industry, which made them think there was room to do something new.\nSo with Hooked, they\u2019re commissioning short stories that take the form of text message conversations. Instead of turning pages, you tap the screen to bring on the next message. The app offers a limited number of free stories but charges a subscription fee (starting at $2.99 per week) for unlimited access.\nChordia suggested that this presents a couple of advantages over a standard book or e-book.

That also helps the company identify the titles that will benefit from a heavy marketing push. And Chordia suggested that the messaging format could eventually lend itself to more interactive approaches, like branching stories.\nBy the way, Gupta acknowledged that there have been other interesting experiments over the past few years, like the New Yorker publishing a Jennifer Egan short story over Twitter. (There\u2019s also a whole genre of cell phone novels that was popularized in Japan.). Oh, and there\u2019s Wattpad, which has millions of users on its social platform for readers and writers.", "no_wm_completion": " disagree with Chordia and Gupta: it kind of sucked.

The app is also more expensive than some of its competitors.\nSo if you\u2019re thinking about starting a business \u2014 or if you\u2019ve read a good book or two over the last few years \u2014 it might be worth giving Hooked a try.

{"prefix": "The morning before I attended the screening of the new X-Men movie, I was cleaning out an old box of mementos and came across an odd flyer. It read \u201cMutants Are People Too!\u201d on the cover. On the inner fold were details of how this country was full of Mutant Oppression and lacking Mutant Equality. I was given this flyer at the first screening of the original X-Men in 2000, when the studio staged a mock protest outside the theater. Actors made up as mutants handed out pamphlets and spoke out against the Senator Kelly character, played in the movie by Bruce Davison.\nIt\u2019s amazing (and maybe a little depressing) that there have been seven X-Men movies made in the past 14 years, and only a few of them are really good. The first two, directed by Bryan Singer, were made before the saturation of comic book movie adaptations we have today and remain impressive, thrilling and a lot of fun. The disappointing X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine were the underwhelming series lows, while the pretty good X-Men: First Class and the underrated The Wolverine mostly succeeded in capturing the gruff, imaginative essence of the series. Now, with Singer returning to direct a series installment for the first time since 2003, the franchise mostly escapes superhero movie fatigue by finding a brilliantly clever new angle to explore.\nThe complex plot opens with the world we know becoming a dark, dreary place in the near future. All mutants are hunted and killed by man-made machines called Sentinels and the X-Men crew is sparse and holed up in China, awaiting possible extinction. By a means too convoluted to explain, Logan (Hugh Jackman) is sent back in time to change the past. His mission: in order to save the future and change the past, he must recruit younger versions of his mentor, Professor X and his adversary, Magneto; not only must he convince them of his quest but also get the two longtime enemies to work together.\nAll of the scenes set in the future, with the familiar crew of mutants fighting off the Sentinels and taking part in effects-heavy mayhem, are tired and feel overly familiar. Once the story settles into the 1970s and becomes a delightful, engaging time travel action/comedy, the movie takes off. I won\u2019t describe it, but there is an incredible scene, set to Jim Croce\u2019s \u201cTime in Bottle,\u201d that astonishes by blending state of the art CGI, crafty cinematography and a wicked sense of humor. While the movie never tops this sequence, there are other set-pieces that deliver on the excitement and spectacle promised by the series.\nUninitiated audiences should see the first two entries, in order to get up to speed. But the story often helps the newcomers by offering flashbacks and exposition, making this feel almost like a stand-alone installment.

He seeks power and becomes, in some ways, less menacing. For these reasons, the casting of Michael Fassbender as the younger Magneto, plays a far more interesting role; although he\u2019s one of my favorite actors, when he plays a villain it\u2019s hard to take him seriously. It\u2019s actually pretty sad because his performance is so good, it helps me suspend my disbelief that he\u2019s a mutant, as if being a mutant weren\u2019t enough punishment.\nUnfortunately, the biggest mistake in the movie is the casting of Ryan Reynolds as the lead.

Scale is a competitive advantage. As a result, a combined Yahoo and Microsoft makes a great deal of sense,\" Financial analyst Clayton Moran from Stanford Group Company said in an e-mail interview after the results were released.\nAsked whether he sees Yahoo as being on the right track or not, Moran, who has a \"Hold\" recommendation on the stock and a 12-month target of $24 per share, said: \"Yahoo is struggling with no clear solution to reignite growth.\"\nStill, Yahoo's top executives repeatedly said, during a conference call to discuss the results, that they were pleased with Yahoo's performance considering the challenges it has faced, including adverse economic conditions and the distractions of the Microsoft acquisition bid and the strident controversies it has generated.\n\"We're executing and delivering against the strategy we laid out, even under extraordinary conditions,\" said CEO Jerry Yang.\nCFO Blake Jorgensen said the conversion of joint broadband deals with AT&T and Rogers Communications to a revenue-sharing format, in late 2007 and early 2008, have hurt Yahoo's revenue growth this year.\nYahoo also said it saw economic conditions affect advertising revenue, especially in categories such as finance, travel and retail.\nYahoo this week managed to reach an agreement with Icahn, who had proposed an alternate slate of director candidates for the Aug. 1 shareholder meeting in order to unseat the entire board. By expanding the board and granting Icahn three seats, Yahoo convinced the billionaire investor to call off the plan. Icahn had indicated previously that his intention was to unseat Yang as Yahoo CEO and attempt to lure Microsoft back to the negotiating table, a possibility that now seems remote.\nThe proxy-contest settlement \"eliminates the distractions and allows us to move forward,\" Yang said.\nThe deal with Google raised eyebrows, since Google's dominance in search advertising is a big reason why Yahoo has struggled financially.

{"prefix": "A new Yale study may help save the tigers.\nResearchers from the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies have come up with a form of spatial modeling to identify the areas of the Kanha Tiger Reserve National Park where the risk of tiger attacks on livestock is highest, in the hopes of reducing farmer-tiger conflict. The study holds potential for mitigating farmers\u2019 economic losses, but could also prove an important part of the conservation puzzle for the dwindling tiger population.\n\u201cIf we can understand what kind of landscape features these cats target when they\u2019re attacking livestock, then we can better predict where to graze, and predict where the high risk areas are,\u201d said Jennie Miller FES \u201915, the study\u2019s lead author who conducted the research for her dissertation.\nSimilar statistical models have been used in past research with wolves in the United States. Though Miller\u2019s model is based off of these, it is distinct because of the differences in large cats\u2019 hunting patterns.\nThe team studied the area within 20 square meters of each kill site. Though past models have focused on larger areas, tigers are more limited in their movements, and therefore, the wider radius is unnecessary.\nWild prey is available to the tigers, but so too is livestock, which the tigers may only attack when the opportunity arises \u2014 if a cow, for instance, had strayed into a densely forested area that the tiger already frequented. Thus, Miller said the model is likely to reduce attacks for many years to come because tigers are unlikely to shift behavior patterns in order to continue feeding on no-longer-easily-available cows.\nThe team worked in central India in the Kanha Tiger Reserve, where the large tiger population had produced more than 400 instances of attack on livestock within that year. The researchers partnered with the local livestock compensation program, through which farmers can report livestock lost to tiger predation to the forest department for reimbursement. This helped provide the team with the data they needed and began to elucidate the relationship between land features and risk.\nThough much of what the model predicted was relatively straightforward \u2014 attacks, for instance, were more frequent in areas farther away from villages and were less frequent in areas with less vegetation \u2014 it did help identify riskier areas in seemingly uniform landscapes.\nProfessor at the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and Miller\u2019s advisor Oswald Schmitz said that though policy to protect tigers already exists, Miller\u2019s work will prove that it really", "gold_completion": " is possible for humans and tigers to coexist peacefully.\nMiller said some changes based on the study, especially fencing in higher-risk areas of the park, are already going into effect. However, there is still a long way to go, and the study is just one important piece of a larger puzzle.\n\u201cTigers are on the brink of going extinct,\u201d Miller said, noting the importance of protecting habitats and reducing illegal poaching. In fact, she identified poaching as the number one challenge tigers face, adding that if it were scaled back, the population would have a solid chance at recovery.\nMiller\u2019s next study will look at farmers\u2019 perception of risk. Identifying the disparities between perceived and actual risk could help reduce tiger attacks even further, Miller said.\nThere are fewer than 3,500 wild tigers left in the world.\nA previous version of this article misstated the class year of Jennie Miller.

To do this, Schmitz\u2019s students are currently working on a model that can replicate the same function as the one employed by Miller and her co-authors.\nIt is now uncertain how the findings will be applied to the rest of India, especially the forests in the neighboring states that are also home to large populations of the rare cat.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of work to be done,\u201d Schmitz said. \u201cThere will be a lot of decisions going on right now,", "gen_completion": " isn\u2019t enough. Schmitz explained that while there are \u201ca lot of problems,\u201d including land use, habitat conservation and even human-tiger conflicts, these threats alone can\u2019t explain tigers\u2019 population declines.\nThough the study was conducted with the help of the Kanha Tiger Management Committee, its impact extends beyond the Kanha Reserve: It could also help conservationists in places such as Namib. To maximize its impact, Miller suggested taking the model\u2019s findings into the conservation planning process to provide a full landscape model for such areas and then tailor it to specific terrain and wildlife populations to maximize its efficacy.\nSchmitz mentioned that a tiger reserve can be a vulnerable location for livestock, and so far his team is unsure of its impact on agricultural development. He and the rest of the scholarship are eager to conduct further research to learn more about the full landscape of conflict between farmers and tigers, which can influence decisions about grazing patterns and protection"}

{"prefix": "By Don Edwards Don Edwards, US representative from California, is chairman of the House Subcommitte on Civil and Constitutional Rights. He was the floor leader for House passage of extension of the Voting Rights Act.\nIf President Reagan and a handful of conservative senators succeed in their scheme to require plaintiffs in Voting Rights Act cases to prove ''intent'' to discriminate, the results will be tragic for minority Americans. A key provision of the bill passed by the House of Representatives on Oct. 5, 1981, by the overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 389-24 will be struck down before it has become law.\nSection 2, which was designed in 1965 to remedy voting discrimination patterns wherever they might exist, authorizes the government or private individuals to ask the federal courts to stop discriminatory practices whether they occur in Mississippi, Alaska, California, or anywhere in the US. If President Reagan is successful in imposing his will, scores of blatantly discriminatory laws and pratices will be unreachable through lawsuits.\nWhen it approved the Voting Rights Act in 1965, it was Congress's intention that in lawsuits to enforce Section 2 the burden of proof on the complaining party not be limited to proof of intent or bad purpose. If discriminatory results were shown, a violation could be found. The House overwhelmingly restated this principle in extending the Voting Rights Act in 1981.\nSection 2 worked very well for the first 15 years of the Voting Rights Act. Suits were filed in jurisdictions where laws enacted many years ago had resulted in black citizens having little or no chance of being elected to local or state offices. These suits were not easy--they required a showing that an aggregate of factors were present in a particular jurisdiction.\nTo make this showing, substantial statistical and other evidence proving the discriminatory impact of voting and election practices and procedures in the local jurisdiction was needed. But important suits were won, and the 1965 intent of Congress in enacting Section 2 was being fulfilled.\nThen in April 1980 the US Supreme Court in a plurality, not a majority, decision overruled the lower court decisions and said that insofar as the City of Mobile, Ala. was concerned, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act could not be used to mandate single-member districts unless the officials who wrote the law back in 1911 had the intent to discriminate against blacks. The Court specifically said that it was not enough to prove the existence of an aggregate of factors, such as a history of segregation, discrimination in registration and voting, disproportionately low numbers of minorities elected to office, racial bloc voting, lack of responsiveness by local officials to minorities, and the lack of access to the political process.\nThe impact of the Mobile decision has been devastating. The US Justice Department abandoned its suit against South Carolina, 30 percent black, the sole remaining state in the Deep South with an all-white legislative body - the state senate. Indeed, a black has not been elected to the South Carolina state senate in this century. The Justice Department dismissed three additional suits, and dropped from consideration other possible suits in cities where black citizens have for decades been discriminated against in the electoral process.\nIn one case, a court, citing the Mobile decision, upheld an election system in Moultrie, Ga., where exclusion of blacks has gone so far that the town actually delegated the running of elections to an all-white social club.\nSince the Mobile decision in April 1980 the Justice Department has not inititated a single lawsuit under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\nMobile has made Section 2 virtually irrelevant. Old laws obviously designed to prevent the election to public office of black Americans can no longer be reached in courts of law.

In creating the Voting Rights Act in 1965 Congress intended that proof or effect, results, was enough, and that to require proof of intent would be a nearly impossible burden. Without the House version of Section 2, the Voting Rights extension will be substantially weaker than the 1965 law. The Reagan amendment would be a giant step backward in America's commitment to the elimination of a hundred years of blatant racial discrimination in voting practices. The President must not be allowed to win this one.\nVoting Rights Act: Is major portion outdated? Supreme Court to hear arguments.", "no_wm_completion": " it may be used as intended. Only this kind of intent will enable the courts to strike down discriminatory laws and practices.\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 was not designed to be a perpetual protection of political rights. Congress may someday decide that, based on the state of civil rights now, it is time to eliminate affirmative action, the use of federal dollars to promote civic awareness, and many other anti-discrimination programs, including Section 2.\nIt would be tragic if those who enacted Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act were forced by the courts to re-enact the 1965 statute. The Court's decision in the landmark Brown decision (1965) established the principle that courts cannot enjoin Congress from passing laws it has already enacted. But unless Congress reinstates federal prerogatives under Section 2 as originally intended, and unless the Congress passes and passes legislation to reinstate Section 2, the same kind of harm that has resulted from the Mobile decision won't disappear, and black Americans will face worse discrimination", "gen_completion": " no district in America is unduly deprived of the vote because it had been deemed in the opinion of the local government to be in violation of the provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\nCongress can stop the damage done by its own legislative action. By keeping Section 2 active, it can assure a stable level of voter registration, acceptable ballot design, reasonable limits on election expenditure, and fair distribution of political office. The need to obtain adequate statistical evidence before filing suit should not be mandatory. The provision demanding proof of intent should not be included in the bill.\nIf Congress keeps Section 2 active, millions more minority citizens will face the threats of government forces when they seek to exercise their right to freedom of the vote.\nBy avoiding the need to prove intent, Congress can protect minority rights without jeopardizing minority security. As far as a judge is concerned, there is simply not sufficient statistical evidence to demonstrate racial hostility, or a history of black voting discrimination, or any other form of discriminatory reason."}

{"prefix": "A \"vegetarian\" gene may have evolved amongst groups of people who have historically eaten less meat.\nA team at Cornell University describes the genetic variation in a study published inMolecular Biology and Evolution -- a variation that they say has \"evolved in populations that have eaten a plant-based diet over hundreds of generations\". That includes areas of India, Africa and East Asia, with a different variation adapted to a seafood diet found in Greenland.\nThe adaptation, the team says, allows those with the gene to \"more efficiently process omega-3 and omega-6 acids and convert them into compounds essential for early brain development and controlling inflammation\". The downside is that it might be linked to some types of cancer and other health problems.\nThe team looked at frequencies of particular alleles in 234 vegetarian people from India and 311 from the US, finding it in 68 percent of Indians and 18 percent of Americans. This is likely, they say, because Northern Europeans are more likely to eat meat and have \"a long history of drinking milk\".\nAdaptations between vegetarian and seafood diets is most striking -- the vegetarian allele has an insertion of 22 bases, something that's missing entirely from the seafood allele.\n\"The opposite allele is likely driving adaptation in the Inuit population,\" said Kaixiong Ye, co-lead author of the paper. \"Our study is the first to connect an insertion allele with vegetarian diets, and the deletion allele with a marine diet.\" \"Several studies have pointed to adaptation in this region of the genome", "gold_completion": ".

This would affect the overall frequency of omega-3 and omega-6 acids in the bodies of the vegetarians.\nBut overall, \"what stands out is that there was a substantial shift towards less omega fatty acids, and we see this across all the genes involved in the process of the omega 6 conversion.\" Meanwhile, the animal-based allele was \"very low\" in all three populations when they were genetically tested -- suggesting the \"genetic landscape\" that's shaping the evolution of modern humans might in fact have a lot of fish lurking in it.\n(", "gen_completion": ",\" said study co-author Jason W.

{"prefix": "In my Tai Chi classes we learn how to pay attention to what we are doing, for it is fundamental to being able to relax, stay balanced and move well.\nSometimes the first and most important step in learning to pay attention is simply experiencing just how difficult it is to do so. Unfortunately most people give up at this point but it is worth considering the implications of spending most of our time being unaware of what is happening both in and around us.\nTo learn anything or develop any skill you have to able to pay attention. For me it is the single most useful attribute that anyone could develop to improve all aspects of their life. Paying attention means to intentionally focus on what is happening in the present moment (both internally and externally) at any given time. It is the art of noticing things without the distraction of thinking and judgement; the art of empirical observation. Paying attention is very simple. It is so simple in fact that it is usually overlooked by almost all of us but actually it underpins everything that we do. To begin with it can be a bit of a tricky skill to develop for it is easy to assume that you are paying attention when in fact your mind is wandering. By training little and often even small improvement can foster great benefits.\nIn terms of how we move and use our bodies it is our ability to pay attention that governs the quality of our actions. A good boxer in a bout, for example, focuses purely on what is happening; he pays attention. He watches and senses his opponent for any precursors to attack or discrepancies in his defence. He is completely in his body, engulfed by accurate real time sense perception. If his mind is dominated by thought then his performance is seriously impeded and a punch on the nose is the result; a sharp reminder not to be distracted by thoughts.", "gold_completion": "\nA good example of not paying attention is when a person drives their car on a familiar route and then can\u2019t recall anything about their journey upon arrival; they daydreamed all the way there. It\u2019s when you\u2019re not paying attention that you can get into trouble!\nYou can vastly improve how you use your body and therefore your health and fitness by paying attention to your body. Most people have very low levels of body awareness and because this is very common in our society it goes largely unnoticed. If I go running, for example, without paying attention to how move then I can seriously hamper the quality of my movement because I ignore the vital feedback that my senses constantly deliver. This results in inefficient movement and usually injury at some point along the way. Funnily enough, when I see dogs out for a run they always look so happy; they just love the experience, but when a human is exercising it is rarely with a smile on their face!", "no_wm_completion": " In the Tai Chi class I am teaching we begin by observing our own body and how our stance, posture and stances are influenced by our environment and in turn the surrounding environment is influenced by our body; the two are in fact inseparable. If we take our body for an example, we can observe how our posture and stances are affected by factors, such as where we are sitting, what environment we are under and so on.\nWhen our entire body is in motion it is easy to forget that the physical structure and processes of our body are at work; paying attention to our stance, posture etc, becomes increasingly vital for maintaining physical balance at all times, at a specific point in time. If a certain movement is not performed correctly from one minute to the next then the physical structure will be altered and its function may be severely compromised.\nAs you may have gathered from this simple observation, it seems that paying attention to what is happening around you makes your life much easier and more enjoyable whilst also", "gen_completion": " In Tai Chi we are not allowed to be distracted by thoughts or ideas. We are not allowed to have any thoughts, opinions or ideas. The idea of the body as a tool has no place; the idea of the body as a vessel for doing simple movements is simply an illusion. If any thought enters our heads without being accompanied by a physical, conscious movement the result is paralysis. The body will not move without active intention and therefore we are left motionless and motionless without reason. I know you are well aware that the universe is nothing but a giant machine which obeys the laws of physics, thus it is useless to try and prove its existence, its meaning and the logical applications to everyday life. I also know you are well aware that the universe is subject to physical limits too so what could possibly stop us from trying to understand what a law applies to us and how we can apply it to the world around us?

Particularly in their own environment of set-aside contracts and the need to progress to full-and-open work to entice potential buyers if and when they wish to sell?\nErin Andrew, managing director of government contract lending at Live Oak Bank, said M&A transactions are certainly an option for small business contractors whose owners either want to exit or take their company into more full-and-open contracts that critical for the next phase of growth.\n\u201cFolks are realizing that small businesses make up a large part of the marketplace and that we need to identify and create strategies that aren\u2019t just fit for mid-market or larger companies but rather that fit the need and cost appetite for small businesses,\u201d Andrew told me.\nLoan programs run by the Small Business Administration are starting to become more prominent as contractors with set-aside status look for options to try and fuel growth, she said.

On average, nearly three-fourths of all government contracts go to the incumbent and some win rates at certain agencies exceed 90 percent for the current holder.\nThat past performance becomes even more prominent as contracting officers and other acquisition staffers retire out of the federal workforce. Andrew said small firms should not discount the option of acquiring a company with that past performance and especially at an agency with high incumbent win rates.\nIt is at least worth \u201clooking into understanding if it\u2019s a better and a more cost-effective path that will allow you to grow much more quickly than if you just grow organically,\u201d Andrew said.", "no_wm_completion": " market for small business entities and firms of all types.\nA great example of this type of consolidation is that the majority of SBA-held real estate loans that are made to small businesses are still managed by a group of people who are still working on a day-to-day basis from a traditional office.\nEven in cases of transactions that offer larger companies a way to expand, they may not want to exit or exit the company with a government loan.\n\u201cIt is a very good opportunity for the small business to really be a part of growth strategies or strategies of a large buyer to expand into a new geographies,\u201d Andrew said.\nWhat to look for when pursuing a deal\nIf the acquisition seems to offer an opportunity to grow, it generally should.\n\u201cThe first couple questions you want to make sure you have answered are: \u2018Can you really double your revenue, quadruple your revenue, tenfold, etc.,?\u2019\u201d Andrew", "gen_completion": " market for small business lenders and providers of private banking services to scale their business accordingly, she said.\nNot surprisingly then, as we look back on last year\u2019s overall market, there continues to be a lot of activity for small business lenders, both through the rise of big-time contractors in the agency\u2019s portfolio of customers and the push to open public-private partnerships in an effort to bring business into a government building with a government contractor\u2019s name and reputation.\nAs Andrew said, there was no surprise that the SBA saw a 10 percent spike in its portfolio to $3.1 trillion at year\u2019s end (a year-to-date total of $3.15 trillion, or $3.27 trillion by the end of 2019, a slight improvement from the $3.13 trillion at year\u2019s end 2018), largely due to a year of good news in 2019 as more people are getting help with things they need.\nNot"}
{"prefix": "Officials are working to convince the public that a sweeping trade deal will help the planet.\nFacing criticism from green groups, the administration is making the case that a sweeping trade deal that President Obama is working to negotiate with Pacific Rim nations won't hurt the environment. In fact, officials argue, the agreement could go a long way toward protecting the planet.\nAs part of a push to sell the deal on Capitol Hill and to the American public, the U.S. trade representative and the State Department will unveil a report on Wednesday highlighting what they say are the potential environmental benefits of the international agreement, a pact that the president views as a cornerstone of his economic legacy.\nThe report arrives as Congress inches closer to passing so-called \"fast-track\" legislation backed by the White House, granting lawmakers an up-or-down vote on any trade deal.\nThe White House contends that the deal will bolster trade and help the United States maintain a competitive advantage in the face of China's rapid rise. But Democratic lawmakers, labor unions, and green groups remain wary of the agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, warning that it could undercut worker rights and erase key environmental safeguards.\nNow, the administration is pushing back against environmental criticism.\nFar from selling out the environment, officials say, the president has used trade as a lever to achieve far-reaching aims that will ultimately leave the environment in far better shape across a wide array of nations. Among those aims are agreements in the deal for countries to curb illegal wildlife-trafficking, fishing, and logging.\n\"We have the chance to finalize a trade agreement that is truly unlike any other ever negotiated: an agreement where every participant has to comply with core international labor and environmental standards.... That's not a complicated choice,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said during a speech delivered in Washington state on Tuesday.\nThe State Department and the U.S. trade representative promise that every last one of those environmental obligations will be fully enforceable and achievable.\nThe administration says it plans to provide assistance in the form of grants and technical support to developing nations such as Brunei, Vietnam, and Malaysia to ensure that they have the ability to follow through on environmental commitments.\nOfficials are also quick to note that nations can be taken to task if they fail to live up to their end of the deal. Any country found in violation could face a formal dispute, which could ultimately result in sanctions.\nObama's trade deal would go well beyond the environmental provisions included in past international agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. And a slate of conservation groups, including the World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy, have praised the administration for its pledge to create conservation safeguards in the agreement.\nThe White House hopes its push will win over critics. But it is unlikely to change hearts and minds among environmentalists dead set against the deal. Part of the reason is that many environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth, say that their criticism of the agreement applies to provisions much broader than anything contained within the environmental chapter.\nCritics from these groups fear that the deal will usher in an onslaught of legal challenges intended to undermine environmental regulations while opening the", "gold_completion": " door for a flood of natural-gas exports to nations such as Japan. This, in turn, the groups say could lead to an uptick in fracking and worsen global warming.\n\"[The deal] will undermine the work that has been done to stimulate clean energy, to transition away from fossil fuels,\" Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said at the Good Jobs, Green Jobs conference in Washington, D.C., last month.\nThe administration has pushed back against these claims, saying that the deal will not undermine public health or environmental safeguards. Officials also argue that the idea that natural-gas exports will result in disastrous environmental consequences is overblown.\n\"Rest assured... we will retain our ability to protect our clean air and water, regulate our economy, and uphold all of the laws of our nation.

{"prefix": "Above: A chatbot beats a travel app.\nMy travel season is coming up soon. I always attend CES in Las Vegas (let me know if you want to chat in person), the SxSW conference in Austin, and a few extra trips here and there. As I Iive up here in Minneapolis, it\u2019s the perfect time to escape the inevitable cold and snow.\nRecently, I\u2019ve been looking into travel options and, as a way to practice what I preach, I\u2019ve been relying entirely on messaging apps like Mezi (which uses AI to find the best deals). I\u2019ve talked to the Google Assistant on a Pixel smartphone I\u2019m testing and relied on chat interfaces. It\u2019s always interesting, as journalist, to apply what I\u2019m testing in my job to making actual plans. When you have to hand over your credit card information and other personal details, your perspective changes.\nAs it turns out, I learned quite a bit about why messaging works better for travel arrangements, mostly due to the time savings. It\u2019s amazing. On Mezi, I typed in my dates and the departure and arrival cities. That\u2019s it. The app is designed to make the process as fluid as possible, and it\u2019s all about finding the best deal. The app I normally use to book my own trips (when I even use an app instead of a website) is Expedia. Yet, I don\u2019t plan on going back to travel apps, and here\u2019s why.\nFirst, let\u2019s clear up one misconception. Making travel arrangements is not rocket science. There are a limited number of flights from Minneapolis to Las Vegas on the dates I\u2019m flying. For some reason, I always think if I spend an hour or more, I might find a better deal. That\u2019s rarely true.\nWhat is true is that most of the travel apps, even the ones that make big promises about saving you money, are searching the same basic airfare options. Sun Country offers roughly the same deal on every site, so a messaging app like Mezi already has a fairly limited number of options to analyze. From what I understand about how the app works, it searches for the best flights at the best times and provides three good options without too much help from a human agent.\nWhat\u2019s changed for me is that I trust the results. I know that these are likely the three best options, so I don\u2019t psyche myself out searching for more economical flights. It helps that I already know the flight should run about $300 or less (this is a vacation destination after all) and shouldn\u2019t make any stops.\nHere are some of the ways this saves me time. I don\u2019t have to use multiple travels apps and try to remember my login for each one. I don\u2019t have to fill out any forms \u2014 Mezi does that for me. I don\u2019t have to pick any flight preferences; Mezi saves this and fills it in. There are a few more subtle benefits, as well. I might need to update the Mezi app once in a while, but not as often as most of the apps I use, which seem to be constantly needing an update. Most of what needs to be updated in a messaging app is on the backend, not within the simple text interface.\nMaybe it\u2019s all an illusion, but I swear I saved about an hour. I have at least two more flights to book, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019", "gold_completion": "ll ever use a travel app or site again.

I asked the agent to do the search once per day for a few days in a row. That way, it helped confirm to me that I wasn\u2019t missing a good deal. I was also able to ask about other details, like whether a certain airline still offers nonstop flights. I want to be able to have a conversation, and no chatbot that is 100% automated does that yet.\nFor my next trip, however, I do plan to try a chatbot that uses all AI. If you know of a good one to try, let me know by email.", "no_wm_completion": "ll be using the same apps for them as well, which actually sounds like a benefit to me.

If Mezi\u2019s technology could truly beat the human travel agent, it would be a miracle. Yet, that seems unlikely. It\u2019s a tough slog for someone who\u2019s so eager to hop on their computer.

{"prefix": "The Bulldogs season ended with a loss to Liberty in the NCAA Tournament.\nSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2013 Lamar Peters had a practice jersey wrapped around his neck. He leaned back in the corner of Mississippi State's locker room at the SAP Center in San Jose, California.\nHe looked as comfortable as he could, and he looked confident, too. His Bulldogs were set to take on Liberty in the first round of the NCAA Tournament roughly 24 hours from the time he sat there and said he felt Mississippi State was ready to turn some heads.\nFriday evening against the No. 12 seed Liberty Flames, Peters turned plenty of them as he scored 21 points and made four 3-pointers.\nBut the Flames turned more.\nLiberty beat the fifth-seeded Bulldogs, 80-76, to oust them from the tournament much sooner than they would have liked. Mississippi State's season ended abruptly after blowing a double-digit lead down the stretch.\n\"It's just a tough, tough pill to swallow, especially the way we had the lead that late in the game,\" MSU head coach Ben Howland said.\nTwo of the three best players on the floor for either team Friday were Peters and MSU senior guard Quinndary Weatherspoon. The best, though, was probably Liberty red-shirt junior Caleb Homesley, who scored 30 points and led Liberty's comeback.\nHomesley caught fire from 3-point range. He made five of his 11 shots from beyond the arc. Three of those came after Mississippi State had built a 10-point lead with roughly seven minutes to go.\n\"I think I just played confident,\" Homesley said. \"I think any shot i take is going to go in. It just happened that they were falling... It could have been anybody any given night, but tonight it was me.\"\nBefore Homesley's assault, the Bulldogs had everything working on both ends of the floor. They racked up eight blocks on the defensive end and wouldn't let Liberty get a good look at the basket. Offensively, Weatherspoon and Peters continued to pace the Bulldogs with a mixture of drives to the bucket and pull-ups from distance.\nWeatherspoon scored 27 points on 6-of-12 shooting in his final game in maroon and white. Any time Mississippi State needed a bucket, he drove to the rim and either made a layup or got to the free throw line, where he made 13 of his 16 shots.\n\"Lamar and I had it going,\" Weatherspoon said. \"I just give the credit to my teammates. I mwan, we all came out and played hard.\"\nThey played hard enough to hold a 63-53 lead with 7:11 left in the game. Then they collapsed. Howland said everything that could have went wrong for Mississippi State, well -- went wrong.\nWeatherspoon and Peters each picked up four fouls, and it affected Mississippi State's offensive flow. The ball ran through each of those players all night. The duo's mentality drastically changed when they got into foul trouble.\n\"It made us settle for threes because we didn't want to go out of control and draw a charge,\" Peters said", "gold_completion": ". \"So it made us play timid.\"\nPeters and Weatherspoon couldn't be as aggressive defensively on the perimeter as they had been previously, which allowed Homesley to get good looks from three. He almost single-handily turned the game on its head with 12 points in a four-minute stretch. Those 12 points gave Liberty a 69-67 lead with less than three minutes left.\nMississippi State eventually took a 70-69 lead, but Liberty senior guard Lovell Cabbil Jr. took after his teammate and popped a 3-pointer to give the Flames the lead again. They never looked back from there.\nSitting in a similar position as he did the day before -- slumped back in a chair with cameras in his face -- Peters wasn't feeling as calm and confident as the day before. Those emotions were replaced by dejection and despair.\n\"I felt like we had it,\" Peters said grimly. \"I felt like we had it.\"", "no_wm_completion": ".\nThey still kept driving to the basket.

But the Bulldogs were just 11-of-34 from 3-point range.\n\"When they got into those foul trouble, guys just had to get aggressive,\" Howland said. \"The defense got better because you can put pressure on their three-point jumpers with guys in there and you can put pressure on their transition offense with guys in there.\"\nBut the key in turning Liberty into a second-half team was Homesley.

The Bulldogs couldn't stay out of the air in transition, and they committed five fouls by the time Davenport's 3-pointer dropped.\nIt looked for a moment as if Peters and Mississippi State were being carried through the court. No one on MSU's roster could move the ball with ease from the perimeter to the rim, their three-point jumpers were swatted out and any pressure the Bulldogs created against Liberty's defense went awry in an instant.\n\"You could have seen the frustration on my players' faces,\" Howland said. \"We turned it over, we didn't get the ball across the"}

{"prefix": "Despite the obvious differences between the biggest IT markets of today, one thing that they all have in common is the importance of data. Focusing on that common thread, it might be easier than you think to shift from one market to a totally new one.\nAt least, that\u2019s what Modus Operandi, a small software company that serves the defense and intelligence communities, is doing as it pushes into the health care market.\nThe company\u2019s niche is semantic technology, which helps \u201cintelligence analysts find specific unique data and correlations of data within the multitude of databases across the intelligence agencies and the military services,\u201d said Rick McNeight, Modus Operandi president.\nIn practice, an intelligence analyst can put a query into a semantic wiki, such as the name of a known terrorist, at which point software will search relevant databases and automatically fill in the wiki with information not only about the terrorist, but about his associates, notable locations, and so on, McNeight said.\n\u201cWe don't just find a needle in a haystack; we find the right needle in the right haystack,\u201d he added.\nThe semantic technology capabilities that McNeight described are just as useful in health care as they are in the defense and intelligence space, and that\u2019s because of how semantic technology works.\n\u201cThe key to semantics is that you create intelligent kinds of models around people's data, and the models you create form these graphs,\u201d said Dr. Eric Little, vice president and chief scientist at Modus Operandi, said Dr. Eric Little, vice president and chief scientist at Modus Operandi.\nThese \u201cknowledge\u201d graphs, as Little called them, can be built into software systems, and analytics can translate them into understandable concepts and relationships, he said.\nDespite coming from a great number of sources, the data that goes into this process can be divided into three general groups: structured, semi-structured and unstructured, Little said.\nIn terms of Modus Operandi\u2019s defense and intelligence work, structured data can be database information, such as map information or people characteristics. Semi-structured data is derived from things like spreadsheets or from table information on the web. Unstructured data can be information that isn\u2019t necessarily stored somewhere, but is rather collected from various internet sources like social media sites.\n\u201cWe spend a lot of time in very large sects of this varying kind of data, and when you look at the health care space, you find a lot of striking similarities,\u201d Little said.\nHealth care data has continuously been collected over the past couple of decades, and especially in the past few years, there has been a push to digitize all of it for easier storage and access.\nWith Affordable Care Act requirements, there has been a push for doctors to not only convert to electronic means of communications, but that the newly electronic information be portable, searchable, and able to provide meaningful", "gold_completion": " use, like better analytics and a more holistic patient approach, Little said.\n\u201cTo put this together in the medical field, you would need access to structured data, to semi-structured data and to unstructured data,\u201d he added.\nFrom a medical perspective, structured data could be things like lab results in a database, or any information about your stay in a hospital, such as what drugs were administered, whereas semi-structured data could be things like billing information. Unstructured data could be things like handwritten doctors\u2019 notes pointing to things like your attitude, mood, family health history, and other things, Little said.\nBroken up into the categories of structured, semi-structured and unstructured, it isn\u2019t difficult to see how data could be used in similar ways despite belonging to different spaces.

{"prefix": "Republicans are, naturally, united in their opposition to the preliminary deal the Obama administration struck with Iran to restrain its nuclear program. And now, the presidential candidates in particular are going to compete with each other to see who can make their opposition more categorical. They're all criticizing it, of course, and Scott Walker has already said that on the day of his inauguration, he'll pull out of the deal. I'm guessing the rest of them will follow suit and pledge something similar. The question is: OK, so on January 20, 2017, you announce that we're out of the deal (since we're in the Republican fantasy world for the moment, let's put aside the involvement of Europe and the UN). What happens next?\nWell for starters, the Iranians would no longer be constrained by the things they agreed to. They could kick out all the inspectors and institute a crash program to create a nuclear weapon if they wanted. Are Republicans saying that Iran would never do that? I don't think so. Yet in practice, the Republican position seems to be: 1) We can never trust the Iranians to adhere to the terms of any nuclear deal we sign with them because of their insatiable thirst for nuclear weapons, so 2) If there's no agreement at all\u2014no limits on nuclear research, no limits on the quantity and purity of uranium they can enrich, no inspections\u2014then everything will be OK.\nTo be clear, I'm not saying this deal is perfect, though a lot of people who know a lot about this issue are arguing that it's far stronger than what they expected (see here, for instance). But Republicans aren't saying we need to reopen negotiations and push for something better. They're just saying we should scrap the agreement, and then... well, they actually don't say what happens then.\nIn effect, the Republican argument is, We've put this dangerous criminal in prison, but I don't think this prison is secure enough. He might escape! So the answer is to tear down the prison and let him go.", "gold_completion": " Then we'll be safe from him.\nSo they ought to be asked: Are you proposing a re-negotiation of this deal? Or are you just saying that if we scrap it and reimpose sanctions on Iran, then they'll capitulate to all our demands? And if that's what you're saying, is there any reason at all to think that might happen? After all, Iran has been under sanctions from the U.S., the EU, and many other countries for years, yet their nuclear program has continued. What will be different without an agreement?\nWe should hear conservatives out on all their specific complaints about this deal. They might have a case to make about particular weaknesses. But in every case, we have to ask: What's your alternative? I haven't yet heard an answer from any of them, other than the few honest enough to say what so many of them are thinking, that no deal will ever work and we should just go ahead and start bombing.", "no_wm_completion": "\nObviously, Iran poses a clear and present danger to Israel, and it has certainly provided us with a good deal of embarrassment by refusing to fulfill its obligations in the past and failing to address its own nuclear program for all these years, but there's nothing wrong with an effort by the Israelis to do whatever they can to keep their nuclear arsenal under tight control. There's nothing wrong with a nuclear deal that prevents Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. These are all things that would be great for Israel.\nThe point, I think, is made clearer by what Scott Walker described as Iran's \"desire for nuclear weapons,\" which he attributed to its \"disdain for its nuclear deterrence capacity.\" But the reason the Americans signed up for this deal is that the Iranians agreed to some reasonable conditions and agreed to let the monitors back in. It's not a good deal if the Americans say, \"Why don't we toss it out, just leave everything in place. You made a deal the first time,", "gen_completion": " If you believe Iran poses a clear and present danger to the United States, fine, I suppose so. But even I think that seems extreme. Iran poses only a marginal and remote threat. It poses zero threat to Israel. Iran is no real nuclear threat even with its billions of dollars in nuclear weapons. America is a real nuclear threat with its billions of dollars in nuclear weapons.\nThe nuclear question goes back to 1776. There are a number of American intellectuals writing now that the idea of a truly sovereign nation, where all people and their laws are legally equal, is dead in the water for this very reason: the U.S. is such a vast, powerful nation that if some rogue regime had the bomb and the will to use it against the United States, many of our neighbors might just follow us to the bomb and the napalm. Iran is just one more rogue state in the long line of rogue states that we've been willing to do business with for more than a hundred years"}

{"prefix": "In the week following the announcement of PostScript Level 3, PCDN spoke to Ian Mitchell, Adobe's European OEM business manager, about page description languages (PDLs), the Web, and Hewlett-Packard's (HP) decision to forsake the standard.\nPCDN: What's a capsule summary of PostScript Level 3? It's being painted as `PostScript for the Web'. Is that right?\nThe whole thing is it brings freer exchange of information between PDF and PostScript so you can print any digital document without losing look and feel. It's a new paradigm of distribute-and-print, rather than print-and-distribute. It's a complete democracy of where you print. We do it all so users don't have to worry about it. For example, in the office where you have a PostScript Level 2 printer you would push a PostScript file byte by byte so it would be slow. PDF is structured in much more intelligent way so that's not necessary.\nIt was a mistake to introduce [PostScript] Level 2 and leave it a year before products and longer for drivers. Drivers will be available immediately with the release of Level 3. Level 3 will be much more of an architecture. Level 2 was a new Red Book. We'll work closely with Microsoft, Apple and others to bring a new component system into place.\nWhen can we expect the first Level 3-based products?\nThe first products will ship in the third quarter of 1997. We're announcing now because we want ISVs to become aware of it although we'll openly publish very little until the first products appear.\nHow much will HP's decision not to use PostScript in the future hurt you?\nIt's a double-edged sword. HP's defection isn't a sign that they don't [like Adobe technology]. To Adobe, it's a revenue and PR loss but it's a recognition that HP sees us as too dominant. On the other hand it allows us to be far more aggressive in positioning ourselves against PCL, which we haven't been able to do in the past. HP hasn't abandoned us; it's only the laser printer side.\nBut I think they've shot themselves in the foot. If you look at the way printing is going, it's all towards colour and speed. To add the same functionality as PostScript to PCL, you'll have to add the same cost. PostScript printers are expensive because you need more RAM, more ROM, more processing, and there's a little bit of market inflation because it's the high", "gold_completion": "-end.

The next step is Personal PostScript, and the best is Level 3.\nThe Web will change everyone's lives and we think we have the technology to [help with] that. HTML is always going to be there. PDF is getting stronger and stronger but it's probably never going to be ubiquitous. We're working with Microsoft, Apple and several others on OpenType to make a new font standard.

With printers, quality is not the main issue: speed is. And the new technologies will take over from laser printers. Dell isn't the only one, I bet. Xerox has already signed up HP for an Epson partnership. We're going to come up with a few new colour products before we launch our LaserJet Pro.

If you had to draw a picture of what colour and speed look like, you could take some inspiration from the Web. You get the idea of being able to send a full page of text; that's no problem for any colour device. With web pages now you can send a full page of text; it's instant delivery. We've already been experimenting with it; it's already in the marketplace so it's early days.

For starters, determining whether their face-of-the-franchise ace\u2019s future is in Los Angeles.\nClayton Kershaw originally had until Wednesday at 9 p.m. PT to opt out of the two years remaining on his contract. But Kershaw and the Dodgers agreed to extend the deadline to Friday at 1 p.m. PT, which offers more time to possibly come to terms on a deal that would keep Kershaw in Los Angeles for longer than the next two seasons.\nNeither offered specifics on the negotiations.\nThe club did remove one thing from its checklist Thursday, signing David Freese and saving $1 million doing it. The Dodgers held a $6 million team option to on Freese, but paid him a $500,000 bonus and then signed him to a one-year, $4.5-million deal.\nThe Dodgers have until 2 p.m. Friday to extend the one-year, $17.9 million qualifying offer to their free agents. Yasmani Grandal and Hyun-Jin Ryu are candidates to receive the offer. Manny Machado, another free agent, isn\u2019t eligible to receive the qualifying offer because he was traded during the season. If the offer is extended and declined, and the player signs elsewhere, the Dodgers would receive a compensatory pick in next June\u2019s draft.\nThe Dodgers have until 10 days after the season \u2014 Nov. 7 at 9 p.m. \u2014 to exercise the $1.1 million team option on manager Dave Roberts\u2019 contract. The Dodgers engaged Roberts in contract discussions during the season without reaching an agreement. Roberts has said he would like to return and the Dodgers have said they would like to retain him.\nOn Thursday, Friedman and Zaidi defended Roberts\u2019s decision-making during the World Series, particularly in Game 4 when he pulled pitcher Rich Hill in the seventh inning with a four-run lead after Hill had held the Red Sox scoreless over 6 1/3 innings.\nFriedman and Zaidi attributed the team\u2019s troubles in the World Series to the offense\u2019s struggles. Machado was acquired during the regular season to help the Dodgers avoid those spells, but the shortstop went 4 for 22 with a walk and zero extra-base hits in the five games while adding to his reputation as someone allergic to hustling. Machado is expected to sign a mega contract this winter as either a shortstop or third baseman.\nThe Dodgers have third baseman Justin Turner under contract for $39 million the next two seasons and are \u201coptimistic\u201d that Corey Seager, whose injuries created the hole at shortstop that Machado filled, will be ready for Opening Day next spring. Seager has undergone elbow ligament replacement and hip surgeries. A return to Los Angeles for Machado is unlikely.\nTo retain Machado \u2014 or sign slugger Bryce Harper or any other marquee free agent \u2014 would almost certainly require the Dodgers to surpass the luxury tax threshold. That\u2019s a line they mindfully dropped under in 2018.

Time to kick back in the yard and fire up the \u2026 stove?\nHmm, that doesn\u2019t sound terribly exciting, does it? But that\u2019s basically what you\u2019re doing when you cook out on a gas grill, which is powered by the same largely flavorless fuel as your kitchen stove.\nTrue fact: Cooking on a gas grill is more convenient than cooking with charcoal.\nIt\u2019s also a lot less special. And, scientifically speaking, it creates less flavorful food.\nTrue fact: A gas grill is more convenient. But it also creates less flavorful food.\nIn other words, a burger is more than the sum of its ingredients. Sure, there are chemical processes occurring in your food that alter its flavors as it heats \u2013 amino acids interacting with sugars, fats breaking down, and so on \u2013 but this delicious chemistry happens whether you cook on gas, charcoal, an electric burner, even an engine block.\nWhat charcoal brings to the party is a healthy heaping of aroma compounds, the other half of the power couple that is flavor. In fact, aroma might be the super starlet in that relationship, because our tongues are actually pretty limited. \u201cThere are only five taste receptors that are well-agreed-upon to exist within your taste buds,\u201d says Sacks. He\u2019s referring to sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and the new kid: umami.\nAnything else you perceive while eating \u2013 that smoky deliciousness, for example \u2013 is courtesy of aroma.\nWhat charcoal brings to the party is a healthy heaping of aroma compounds, the other half of the power couple that is flavor.\nAromas are released when you bite into your food", "gold_completion": ". They travel up your retronasal cavity, and light up your olfactory receptors.

But food grilled over a charcoal flame has a special one: guaiacol.\nTranslation: Cooking over charcoal makes your food taste like bacon. Let me repeat that: blah blah charcoal blah blah BACON.\nSo if you have two identical steaks, cooked at identical temperatures, for the same amount of time, where the only difference is that one is cooked over charcoal and one is cooked over gas, what will be the end result? The charcoal-cooked steak will taste more like bacon.\nCheck out the other side of the debate: why gas (yes, gas!) is better than charcoal.\nJoe Brown is the editor of Wired.com.", "no_wm_completion": ", but they can also be triggered by other elements in your kitchen environment.\nFor example, some flavors come from chemicals used to sanitize the food chain in the kitchen. \u201cWe\u2019re exposed to lots of antimicrobial ingredients like bleach,\u201d says Sacks. \u201cWe inhale the particles that help destroy bacteria and viruses that threaten us.\u201d\nThis same science also produces a smell that may be helpful for cooking.\nThe aroma compound butane, for example, has been associated with good-smelling frying. But what it\u2019s also produced in your kitchen may not be a desirable aroma if you\u2019re worried about odor. Butane is an odorant that you can\u2019t tell if you smell it.

And these aroma compounds are also the foundation for what Sacks calls \u201cthe delicious flavor.\u201d\nLet\u2019s take, say, that Super Soaker with all that BBQ sauce and the melted cheese.\n\u201cIf you remove that cheese, there\u2019s really no good, flavorful cheese left,\u201d Sacks adds. The same principle applies to sauces. If the sauce is on top of the cheese, the flavor actually becomes less robust and, even more fundamentally, flavorful.\nSome may even argue that heat brings out the super-salty, umami flavor in other meats. Others insist that all the heat of the charcoal takes the edge off. And that\u2019s really a matter of taste, isn\u2019t it? Even if we do think we actually know what we are eating.\nBut Sacks and his colleagues argue that"}
