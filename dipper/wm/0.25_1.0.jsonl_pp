Look no further than the example of BP.\nAs one of the world's largest oil producers, BP has a troubled safety record. As Forbes reports, one of BP's plants has an unusually tragic past, including an explosion in 2005 that killed 15 workers and injured 180. This plant also reported 23 worker fatalities in the three decades that preceded the 2005 accident.\nWhen Marathon Petroleum, the fourth-largest oil refiner in the U.S., bought the plant from BP, many in the industry thought it was a risky move. But Marathon had ideas for how to rectify the situation by instituting a culture centered on safety.\nRemedying the culture required a review of the plant's existing safety procedures. Following the 2005 explosion, federal investigators pointed to BP's problematic safety culture -- for example, with managers who were \"checking off boxes\" rather than promoting best practices for safety -- as the cause of the plant's many safety problems. BP failed to respond and paid dearly for its inaction in 2010, when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, killing 11 and spilling more than 3 million barrels of oil. The incident cost the company $54 billion in damages.\nAs BP's record illustrates, organizational culture matters a great deal to employee safety. Cultures in which employees are engaged in their work are safer places to work. Gallup's 2016 meta-analysis study -- which examined more than 82,000 business units and 1.8 million employees in 230 organizations, across 49 industries and in 73 countries -- shows that business units with engagement scores in the top quartile of Gallup's employee engagement database have 70% fewer safety incidents compared with bottom-quartile units.\nTheir employees are committed to doing quality work. When workers are committed to a standard of excellence in all they do, it's natural for them to adhere to best practices that prevent safety incidents. When employees are dedicated to quality, they go the extra mile to do things right the first time. By taking the right strategic action -- for example, by holding employees accountable for quality -- leaders can develop a workforce that makes smart decisions throughout the day and promotes a culture of workplace safety.\nThe mission or purpose of the company makes employees feel their job is important. Many of the world's most engaged organizations maintain a purpose-driven culture. Their leaders know why the company exists and ensure that employees understand and identify with that purpose. When workers embrace the mission of an organization and connect with that purpose both personally and professionally, they are more likely to think \"big picture\" in all areas of their work. Employees who are aligned with the company's mission are also more likely to approach their work with thoughtfulness and attention to detail, which contributes to a culture of safety.\nEmployees feel that their opinions count. It's a simple notion: Listen to workers who are closest to the action. These individuals offer a front-line perspective on organizational problems and often are well-versed in preventing and overcoming them.

Alex's guardian, grandmother Susan Caruana, 62, says her daughter and ex-husband previously lived on a commune in Morocco with Alex in 2014 as part of an \"alternative lifestyle\" which she believes lies behind the youngster's disappearance. She said: \"On the Sunday, they were due back in the afternoon and my husband was going to go and pick them up. I got this message on Facebook and it was a YouTube video of the three of them. \"They all spoke on it and Melanie said the reasons why they had done what they had done. \"Alex said it was a million times better being with his mum and granddad. Obviously it hurt me a bit but then my other concerns kicked in. \"The reason I believe they have done this is because basically my lifestyle, my belief systems, are not what they agree with - just simply living day to day, how normal people do. \"They didn't want him to go to school, they don't believe in mainstream school.\" She added: \"I just want to say to my grandson Alex, I love you so much and please, please just get in contact. \"We always did something nice with him on his birthday. We'd have a party or go bowling with his friends, his cousins and all that. \"I just want to see him.

The Last of Us: Remastered is dropping on the PlayStation 4 tomorrow. The new version includes increased visual fidelity, better graphics enhancements, as well as native 1920 x 1080p. Naughty Dog also took an opportunity to boost up the game's frame-rate from the barely-hitting-30 frames per second on the PlayStation 3 to 60 buttery frames per second on the PlayStation 4. Naughty Dog decided to leverage the power of the PlayStation 4 to up the core specs of the award-winning 2013 outing from Sony. The Last of Us Remastered includes all the previously released content for the game, including the DLC and add-ons that found a kind home on the PlayStation 3. Players will get the extra content for free, including the single-player and multiplayer content. There have also been rumors that new DLC is being planned to release for both the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4 versions of the game at some point down the line. The DLC is supposed to be a brand new multiplayer map pack that will extend the replay for players who like to get competitive against one another in the online portion of the game.

Robert Precht, a U.S. defense lawyer and legal scholar at the University of Montana, is helping Japanese judges, prosecutors, defense lawyers and citizens to implement the change. He spoke to journalists in Tokyo on Thursday. \"The saibanin system and these other reforms are intended to transform Japanese citizens from viewing themselves as governed objects into governing objects,\" Precht says. For each trial, there will be a panel of three judges and six jurors, who will be citizens selected at random. The jury panel will sit in the same room with the judges to deliberate on the evidence and reach a verdict. If the verdict is guilty, the jurors will also vote on the sentence, and their votes will be equal to those of the judges. The aim, Precht says, is to bring more transparency to the the court system. And to keep jurors from imposing their own bias on a case. Precht says the role of the Japanese jury is much different from that of an American jury, which merely decides whether the defendant is guilty or not. Unlike the American system, in which a defendant has the right to appeal the sentence, the Japanese system will allow jurors to recommend penalties. Professor James Watson of Vanderbilt University in the United States, who teaches a course on jury trial theory, says the new system will also require Japanese prosecutors to be better trained, because they will be involved in trials along with the judges. <sent> Japan currently has a high court system, where criminal decisions are made by judges alone, with a system of jury trials to decide cases involving serious crimes, especially murder. The system for serious and violent crimes is very different from U.S. juries, where jurors in murder cases can vote to convict or acquit. \"In Japan, everybody can go into a courthouse and there is no jury room,\" says Watson. \" </sent>", "output": ["the court system.

The results of the massive, multi-million dollar modernization project were unveiled during a ribbon-cutting ceremony yesterday. The new Electronics Maintenance Enclosure provides a revitalized, accommodating and comfortable workspace for personnel supporting the joint warfighter. The event was attended by CECOM commanding general, Maj. Gen. Randy Taylor, distinguished visitors, depot leaders and members of the workforce. \"Tobyhanna's responsibilities are vast and critical to the mission,\" Taylor said, adding that the quality of work performed here is indicative of how much the workforce cares about the Soldiers. \"The breath of operations here to sustain, overhaul, fabricate, engineer and provide worldwide logistics support for the Army's massive fleet of communications and intelligence systems is extraordinary -- this building is the heart of it all.\" This enclosure will be home to hundreds of employees who will reap the benefits of the innovative ideas used to create a state-of-the-art and eco-friendly environment. Tobyhanna's commitment to reducing its environmental footprint, was the motivation behind employing green technologies such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design -- more commonly known as LEED -- to enhance the energy efficiency of the building's systems. \"These enhanced design features will significantly improve the quality of work environment for depot employees,\" said Col. Nathan Swartz, depot commander. \"The true benefit behind this modernization project will be realized by the men and women serving our nation.\" The high-tech facility, originally built in the early 1950s, was designed in line with current trends and best industry practices. The engineers included new work benches and tool cabinets to create a more productive workspace. In addition, the space boasts a new locker room and two new break areas. The room has improved lighting and the open floor plan offers flexibility to modify the space to meet the needs of future workload. The 30,000-square-foot enclosure boasts a raised floor that can be easily reconfigured for changing mission needs and is certified according to aerospace quality standards and electrostatic hazard protection requirements. The building features two elevators, one located in the warehouse area and one that serves levels three through six. These elevators are designed to accommodate specialty equipment. The space is intended to protect both personnel and equipment and will eliminate the need for employees to come in contact with a potentially dangerous environment when entering and exiting the building. The installation's drive to improve its work space was complemented by renovations to the lower level of the building, which includes a commercial kitchen, laundry room, administrative offices, storage space and a conference room. This effort was part of a $14.5 million dollar construction project to replace aging electrical and communications systems with the latest technology. The project is expected to cost about $8,500,000 and a relocation of more than 8,500 employees is expected to take place as a result of the construction. <sent> The upgrades are a direct result of a national defense initiative undertaken by the Pentagon and directed at improving contractor facilities and amenities.

{"prefix": "By Monday night, 23-year-old Tori Kelly might be in possession of her very first Grammy. But only a year ago, she was a relative unknown whose audiences were rooted mainly in YouTube subscriptions.\nKelly, who auditioned for American Idol's ninth season as a teenager in 2010, was cut from the show just before the its live semi-finals after some particularly harsh criticism from judge Simon Cowell. While the rejection hit Kelly hard, she told Ryan Seacrest last year it incited her to buckle down on her craft and prove her worth as a musician.\n\"I was bummed when I got cut, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then it was kind of awesome because, I think, by getting cut from the show, something stirred up in me to want to write.\"\nAnd that's precisely what she did. In 2012, after releasing six-track EP Handmade Songs By Tori Kelly that Kelly, herself, produced in her bedroom, the singer caught Scooter Braun's eye, and found herself under Capitol Records' management within the year.

It is not without irony that Robson\u2019s probable introduction at the highest level coincides with England\u2019s stated attempt to regain a more \u2018English\u2019 feel to the national team. Yet England will have no hesitation in making him Alastair Cook\u2019s opening partner for the first Test against Sri Lanka if he carries on the form for Middlesex which saw him score 1,180 first-class runs last season at 47. \u2018Look, I grew up in Australia,\u2019 said Robson. \u2018I still go back there occasionally and my family live there. Robson, a technically accomplished opener with a hint of Mike Atherton about him, already has one influential supporter in director of cricket at Middlesex and England selector Angus Fraser. \u2018It\u2019s going to be a challenge for him this summer because a lot of people are going to be looking at him but that was the case in the winter when, as an \u201cAussie\u201d boy as such, he succeeded in Australia with the Lions, which showed he\u2019s got a lot of nous,\u2019 said Fraser. Robson appeared for Australia Under 19s and so disappointed are they to lose him that they changed their eligibility rules to make it easier for him to play domestic cricket as a non-overseas player. But the lad\u2019s head is not for turning, despite attempts from his Middlesex colleague Chris Rogers to turn it, not even after seeing his adopted country thrashed by his native one. The coaches who have worked with Robson believe he is ready for Test cricket. Does he? \u2018I know how important the next couple of months with Middlesex are going to be and if I keep performing well you never know. I\u2019ll just do my best and see how we go,\u2019 he said. And if and when the call comes, Robson is adamant that he will even have the support of his Australian father, who works as a coach in the indoor school at the iconic Sydney Cricket Ground. \u2018Both my parents have always been totally supportive,\u2019 said Robson. \u2018It\u2019s just the way my life has panned out. It would be even more amazing if he opens the batting at Lord\u2019s against Australia next year. HE MUST BE BETTER THAN 'RAT WHO JOINED SINKING SHIP'!

They levy various charges towards premium allocation, policy administration and switching. As mandated by the insurance regulator, pension ULIPs should guarantee at least the total premium paid by the policyholder at the time of pay out.

In addition, the Aussie gained substantial ground, while the Yen was mildly higher.\nA more technical EURUSD analysis shows that the rate made another fresh recent high on Tuesday at the 1.4247 level within an impressive rally that commenced at the important 1.2873 reversal point of January 10th. Although the rate ended slightly lower on the day, this rally in EURUSD is still expected to continue near term.\nThis most recent high continues to support a Euro forecast that targets the key 1.4281 reversal level of November 4th, 2010 in the coming sessions. Above that major resistance point, resistance then shows up at the 1.4579 level for EURUSD.\nIn addition, the rate\u2019s key 200-day Moving Average is now at 1.3321 and rising. This indicates a bullish medium term outlook for the rate and its level should effectively limit downside price action until a significant trend reversal takes place in EURUSD.\nAlthough EURUSD\u2019s 14-day RSI has come off somewhat from its former almost overbought levels seen during last week\u2019s dramatic rise, the indicator is still reading in the upper part of neutral territory at 66 that could impede upside price action in the near term.\nUSDJPY spent most of Tuesday\u2019s session trading in a tight range between 80.83 and 81.27, an even tighter range than that seen the previous day. A sustained breach of either side of this range should yield a measuring objective of ~ 60 pips from the breakout point, with the rate needing to overcome resistance at 81.98 to push significantly higher.\nFurthermore, the chart for USDJPY is still dominated by the rate having just made a fresh post-war low of 76.41 during last Thursday\u2019s session. That level now remains key support to break in order to see further downside for USDJPY.\nUntil that support point breaks, look for additional corrective activity to the upside to prevail, with the current consolidation taking on the look of a possible pennant formation that could resolve into another sharp rally of a similar magnitude to that seen from 0.7641 to 81.98.\nThe Aussie rallied as far as 1.0127 on Tuesday and made a fresh recent high in its most recent sharp rise.

In addition, the Aussie gained substantial ground, while the Yen was mildly higher. A more technical EURUSD analysis shows that the rate made another fresh recent high on Tuesday at the 1.4247 level within an impressive rally that commenced at the important 1.2873 reversal point of January 10th. Although the rate ended slightly lower on the day, this rally in EURUSD is still expected to continue near term. This most recent high continues to support a Euro forecast that targets the key 1.4281 reversal level of November 4th, 2010 in the coming sessions. Above that major resistance point, resistance then shows up at the 1.4579 level for EURUSD. In addition, the rate\u2019s key 200-day Moving Average is now at 1.3321 and rising. This indicates a bullish medium term outlook for the rate and its level should effectively limit downside price action until a significant trend reversal takes place in EURUSD. Although EURUSD\u2019s 14-day RSI has come off somewhat from its former almost overbought levels seen during last week\u2019s dramatic rise, the indicator is still reading in the upper part of neutral territory at 66 that could impede upside price action in the near term. USDJPY spent most of Tuesday\u2019s session trading in a tight range between 80.83 and 81.27, an even tighter range than that seen the previous day. A sustained breach of either side of this range should yield a measuring objective of ~ 60 pips from the breakout point, with the rate needing to overcome resistance at 81.98 to push significantly higher. Furthermore, the chart for USDJPY is still dominated by the rate having just made a fresh post-war low of 76.41 during last Thursday\u2019s session. That level now remains key support to break in order to see further downside for USDJPY. Until that support point breaks, look for additional corrective activity to the upside to prevail, with the current consolidation taking on the look of a possible pennant formation that could resolve into another sharp rally of a similar magnitude to that seen from 0.7641 to 81.98. The Aussie rallied as far as 1.0127 on Tuesday and made a fresh recent high in its most recent sharp rise.

{"prefix": "Although there's still room for improvement, streaming video content around your house (and beyond) has never been easier.\nThe popularity of media streaming devices such as Apple TV and the Xbox 360 has given a great boost to home theater. It begs the question of whether or not you can equip the vaunted \"connected home\" yet. We're close, but I think there's still some room for improvement, particularly with the various incompatible flavors of DRM out there. That said, there's a plethora of premium content out there for your viewing pleasure, and a growing number of devices to stream it and watch it on.\nThere are two ways to acquire content: record your own or download it. Each has its pluses and minuses, which I hope to discuss more over the next few months. Suffice to say that if you buy your TV commercial-free from the Apple iTunes store (we won't get into illicit downloads for now), you'll need Apple TV. If you record your own, you'll need a Media Center Edition (MCE) PC and an Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender. You can also buy and download content directly to the Xbox, but the selection on Xbox Live Marketplace is fairly sparse at this time.\nAs Windows Vista (Premium and Ultimate versions) has incorporated MCE, many new PCs will let you stream video to an Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender support. All-in-one PCs such as the HP TouchSmart IQ770 provide a wealth of media features, and rigs such as the Velocity Micro CineMagix Grand Theater are specially tailored to home theater.\nBoth the Xbox and the Apple TV sit on your network. They let you watch your TV, home videos, and photos on your TV in your living room. Xbox 360 supports 720p HDTV content, while Apple TV is limited to 480p. Apple TV works with both Windows and Macs. Predictably, Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender support is Windows-only.\nWith Slingbox Pro hooked into your home network, you're not just restricted to streaming content around the house. In fact, you can stream TV content around the world when you travel. You can receive it on a PC that has SlingPlayer software installed or to a Windows Mobile handheld running SlingPlayer Mobile.\nWhether you want your home theater strictly for home or also to go, we have a solution for you.

The popularity of media streaming devices such as Apple TV and the Xbox 360 has given a great boost to home theater. It begs the question of whether or not you can equip the vaunted \"connected home\" yet. We're close, but I think there's still some room for improvement, particularly with the various incompatible flavors of DRM out there. That said, there's a plethora of premium content out there for your viewing pleasure, and a growing number of devices to stream it and watch it on. There are two ways to acquire content: record your own or download it. Each has its pluses and minuses, which I hope to discuss more over the next few months. Suffice to say that if you buy your TV commercial-free from the Apple iTunes store (we won't get into illicit downloads for now), you'll need Apple TV. If you record your own, you'll need a Media Center Edition (MCE) PC and an Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender. You can also buy and download content directly to the Xbox, but the selection on Xbox Live Marketplace is fairly sparse at this time. As Windows Vista (Premium and Ultimate versions) has incorporated MCE, many new PCs will let you stream video to an Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender support. All-in-one PCs such as the HP TouchSmart IQ770 provide a wealth of media features, and rigs such as the Velocity Micro CineMagix Grand Theater are specially tailored to home theater. Both the Xbox and the Apple TV sit on your network. They let you watch your TV, home videos, and photos on your TV in your living room. Xbox 360 supports 720p HDTV content, while Apple TV is limited to 480p. Apple TV works with both Windows and Macs. Predictably, Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender support is Windows-only. With Slingbox Pro hooked into your home network, you're not just restricted to streaming content around the house. In fact, you can stream TV content around the world when you travel. You can receive it on a PC that has SlingPlayer software installed or to a Windows Mobile handheld running SlingPlayer Mobile.

British politicians are now calling on Facebook to be more transparent about its internal investigation into data misuse. The British data regulator plans to fine Facebook the maximum amount possible over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. On Tuesday, the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) announced that it will hit Facebook with a \u00a3500,000 (roughly $663,000) penalty over two breaches of the UK Data Protection Act linked to the incident, in which political research firm Cambridge Analytica misappropriated tens of millions of users' personal data. \"The ICO's investigation concluded that Facebook contravened the law by failing to safeguard people's information,\" the organisation said in a statement. \"It also found that the company failed to be transparent about how people's data was harvested by others.\" The sum is barely even a slap on the wrist for Facebook, which had revenues of more than $40 billion in 2017, but is the maximum possible under the applicable legislation. In a statement, Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: \"New technologies that use data analytics to micro-target people give campaign groups the ability to connect with individual voters. But this cannot be at the expense of transparency, fairness and compliance with the law.\" \"Fines and prosecutions punish the bad actors, but my real goal is to effect change and restore trust and confidence in our democratic system,\" she said. Facebook says it will respond \"soon\" The ICO is also launching a criminal prosecution against SCL Elections, an organisation affiliated with Cambridge Analytica, and has sent warning letters to 11 political parties and \"notices compelling them to agree to audits of their data protection policies.\" Facebook has a chance to respond to the ICO before a final decision is made on the fine. The company has said it plans to do so \"soon.\" In an emailed statement, Facebook chief privacy officer Erin Egan said: \"As we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015.

In addition, Javelin senior analyst Nick Holland points out that \u201cconsumers have a short memory, [and are also] well-protected by their credit card companies\u201d in terms of limiting their liability for unauthorized purchases.\nHolland explains that even though we reacted with \"shock and horror\" following the massive Target (NYSE:TGT) data breach at the end of 2013, there is an upside: The incident forced the public and the government to finally address the vulnerabilities of our current system.\nHaving to sign a receipt for a purchase will eventually go the way of transistor radios and flip phones. You know those electronic signature pads at many checkouts? In Holland\u2019s words, signing one is \u201clike a drunk writing on an Etch-a-Sketch.\u201d Not only does it not remotely resemble your actual handwriting, it\u2019s barely legible. (When is the last time the clerk even bothered to compare it to the signature on the back of your credit card?) Using your fingerprint would be a lot safer. The folks at Apple have already anticipated this and have added a fingerprint scanner to new iPhones. Your voice might also be used to authenticate your purchase down the road.\nFive years from now, the study forecasts all types of electronic payments to increase as cash purchases fall to 17% and checks to 5%.\nFrom the consumer\u2019s perspective, consider the everyday example of putting gas in your car. If you\u2019re paying by cash, you fill your tank, walk into the store, stand in line to pay and wait for the cashier to make change. Compare this to driving up to the pump, swiping your credit card and immediately driving away after you fill up.\nThere\u2019s also the \u201cup-spend\u201d factor: If you\u2019re using plastic, your spending is not limited by the amount of cash in your wallet.\nHolland adds that electronic transactions are \u201can international leveler.\u201d If you have a credit card, travel outside the U.S. no longer requires you to bring a wad of foreign currency or travelers checks. Likewise, foreign visitors to this country can swipe their American Express card and pay it off in their country&apos", "gen_completion": ";s currency.\nWhat Does this Mean for Credit Cards?\nWhat does this mean for an organization\u2019s financial health?\nIn addition to creating a sense of security for consumers and a stronger, more effective identity verification process, extending the use of plastic across the globe can be a boon to card issuers in the short term.\nThe research firm S&P believes that the use of plastic will increase to almost 50% by 2016. As we don\u2019t need to make checks or cash anymore in most circumstances, American Express expects us to use plastic more than the average American. In addition, American Express sees higher adoption of the plastic card as a medium to meet customers\u2019 needs. Because of the high value of plastic cards, it\u2019s common for issuers to give customers the option of having a balance on both their plastic and a balance with their card.\nBut it also allows them more options to extend the use of their plastic card.

In addition, Javelin senior analyst Nick Holland points out that \u201cconsumers have a short memory, [and are also] well-protected by their credit card companies\u201d in terms of limiting their liability for unauthorized purchases. Holland explains that even though we reacted with \"shock and horror\" following the massive Target (NYSE:TGT) data breach at the end of 2013, there is an upside: The incident forced the public and the government to finally address the vulnerabilities of our current system. Having to sign a receipt for a purchase will eventually go the way of transistor radios and flip phones. You know those electronic signature pads at many checkouts? In Holland\u2019s words, signing one is \u201clike a drunk writing on an Etch-a-Sketch.\u201d Not only does it not remotely resemble your actual handwriting, it\u2019s barely legible. (When is the last time the clerk even bothered to compare it to the signature on the back of your credit card?) Using your fingerprint would be a lot safer. The folks at Apple have already anticipated this and have added a fingerprint scanner to new iPhones. Your voice might also be used to authenticate your purchase down the road. Five years from now, the study forecasts all types of electronic payments to increase as cash purchases fall to 17% and checks to 5%. From the consumer\u2019s perspective, consider the everyday example of putting gas in your car. If you\u2019re paying by cash, you fill your tank, walk into the store, stand in line to pay and wait for the cashier to make change. Compare this to driving up to the pump, swiping your credit card and immediately driving away after you fill up. There\u2019s also the \u201cup-spend\u201d factor: If you\u2019re using plastic, your spending is not limited by the amount of cash in your wallet. Holland adds that electronic transactions are \u201can international leveler.\u201d If you have a credit card, travel outside the U.S. no longer requires you to bring a wad of foreign currency or travelers checks. Likewise, foreign visitors to this country can swipe their American Express card and pay it off in their country&apos x;s local currency. What does this mean for credit cards? In addition to giving consumers peace of mind and making the identity verification process more secure and effective, in the short run, it\u2019s a boon for credit card issuers. The research firm S&P estimates that credit card usage will increase to nearly 50% in 2016. And since we will not need checks or cash in most cases, American Express expects that its cardholders will spend more than the average American. For that reason, the company expects a higher percentage of people to use their cards to satisfy their needs. Since there\u2019s such a high value on credit cards, issuers often allow customers to use their cards to keep a balance.

The research group has extensive experience with viruses in humans and nonhuman primates \u2014 such as HIV and influenza \u2014 and their work will be conducted in secure facilities designed for the safe study of potentially harmful viruses.\nTheir work will start with basic questions about Zika virus infection.

That planning will soon culminate in some of the first experiments studying Zika virus in monkeys, conducted by a broad UW\u2013Madison team that includes the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center and expertise in infectious disease, pregnancy and neurology. Pathobiological sciences Professor Jorge Osorio and research scientist Matthew Aliota, who were first to identify the Zika virus circulating in Colombia in October, provided essential Zika virology expertise. Ted Golos, professor of obstetrics and comparative biosciences, studies how other infections during pregnancy impact newborn health. The research group has extensive experience with viruses in humans and nonhuman primates \u2014 such as HIV and influenza \u2014 and their work will be conducted in secure facilities designed for the safe study of potentially harmful viruses. Their work will start with basic questions about Zika virus infection. Very little is known about the virus even though more than 50 years have passed since it was discovered in the Zika Forest in Uganda. Until recently, Zika was expected to cause little more than flu-like symptoms \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists fever, joint pain and a headache \u2014 in about 20 percent of the people it infected. The rapid spread of the virus and potential connection to an otherwise rare birth defect have drawn plenty of attention from the public and from government officials. In January, the National Institutes of Health made Zika virus research a high priority, and the groundwork underway at UW\u2013Madison led to NIH support for a series of studies of the virus in macaques, monkeys whose physiology and immune systems are similar to humans. The researchers will track the effects of initial infections, but also try to establish whether one Zika virus infection provides some protection against future infection \u2014 like chicken pox does. Zika does not mutate particularly fast, the feature of HIV and influenza that makes those viruses hard to pin down with vaccines (like HIV) and leaves people open to reinfection seasonally (like flu). This may make Zika easier to head off with a vaccine, but the best sort of immune response to provoke with a vaccine is not yet even well understood, and the evolution of the virus may make it even harder to eliminate altogether. This is one of the directions that UW\u2013Madison scientists believe the Zika virus presents and they\u2019ll start soon to explore that possibility. A follow-up study, funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will look at the effects of Zika infection on neural development in fetuses. The research complements the work being done by a team at the National Primate Research Center that includes Michael Pollard, a pathobiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and Osorio, who was a graduate student at UW\u2013Madison when he discovered the first Zika-related viruses in Uganda in 2007.

{"prefix": "1947: Capt. Charles E. \u201cChuck\u201d Yeager pilots the rocket-powered Bell X-1 to a speed of Mach 1.07, becoming the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound. In breaking the sound barrier, Yeager becomes the fastest man alive \u2014 and the legend of the X-Planes begins.\nAs airplanes flew faster and faster throughout the 1930s, pilots began to experience a number of problems associated with the increased airspeed. Aircraft such as the Lockheed P-38 and Republic P-47 flew just fine at ordinary speeds in level flight. But if pilots put them in a high-speed dive, they began to experience control problems that led to the deaths of several pilots.\nThe main problem facing these pilots was the aerodynamic condition known as compressibility. Simply stated, at speeds well below the speed of sound, most of the air molecules have time to get out of the way of an aircraft as it approaches, and the density of the air does not change.\nHowever, as the speed of sound is approached, the air molecules can\u2019t get out of the way, and more of them hit the aircraft. The impact compresses the air in front of the aircraft and increases the air density. Eventually shock waves form around the airplane, affecting the lift and drag. These changes were not well-understood and led to the loss of control in several aircraft.\nBecause the effects of compressibility are directly related to the speed of sound, a ratio is used to describe the speed of an aircraft. The Mach number is the speed at which an object is traveling relative to the speed of sound at a particular temperature. The name is in honor of physicist Ernest Mach, who studied high-speed gas dynamics.\nThe Bell X-1 was developed to research aerodynamics in the transonic region, or speeds just below and just above the speed of sound. After numerous flights with civilian test pilots, Capt. Yeager of the newly formed U.S. Air Force made his first powered flight in the X-1 on Aug. 29, 1947, high over the Mojave Desert of southern California.\nThe problem Yeager was experiencing was the ineffectiveness of the X-1\u2019s pitch controls, as shock waves essentially created an aerodynamic shadow around the tail. Changes were made to the horizontal tail controls, allowing Yeager to control the airplane's ability to pitch up and down, and flights continued. This knowledge would lead to the all-flying tail, or stabilator, standard on all supersonic fighters today.\nYeager was nursing two broken ribs on the morning of Oct. 14, after being thrown from his horse on a ride the night before. He boarded the B-29 bomber that was to carry the Bell X-1 to altitude. The plan was to fly to Mach 0.97. But Yeager says the new moving tail boosted his morale, and he wanted to fly faster.\nAfter climbing down into the X-1, which was carried like a bomb in the belly of the B-29, Yeager\u2019s friend and fellow test pilot Jack Ridley handed him a short, sawed-off section of broomstick. Yeager would use it to close the canopy of the X-1, because his broken ribs prevented him from closing the latch normally.\nPeople on the ground heard what sounded like distant thunder.

{"prefix": "A city bus carrying 31 people plunged off a bridge here and plowed through the outer edge of an apartment roof this afternoon after the driver was shot by a passenger. The driver, and a person suspected of shooting the driver, were both killed, the police said. The 29 others were injured.\nThe two-section bus was just starting to cross Aurora Avenue Bridge, which spans the Lake Union ship canal, about 3:10 P.M. when the driver was shot by a passenger, the police said. The bus, heading south, jumped a lane of northbound traffic, hit a van, then crashed through a guardrail and fell 50 feet, landing upright in an apartment garden in the Fremont district, an area of residential buildings, restaurants and businesses.\nPolice officers did not disclose a motive for the shooting. They said that two people were involved, and that the second person was among the injured taken to the hospital. The gun was recovered at the hospital, the police said.\nWitnesses described a scene of panic as people with broken bones and bleeding cuts tried to crawl out of the bus. Rescue officials pulled out several people who were stuck in the bus.\nMr. Badgley said he had seen two injured people on the roof of the apartments. When aid units arrived, they gave emergency treatment to people who could be seen on the apartment roof.\nAll the passengers were injured, fire department officials said. Fifteen of the injured were in critical condition tonight and 10 were listed in serious condition, said a Fire Department spokeswoman, Sheila Strehle.\nThe driver, whose name was not released by the police, was thrown from the bus, fire officials said.\nThe bus is a two-compartment vehicle with the two units held together by an accordion-like mechanism.

The driver, and a person suspected of shooting the driver, were both killed, the police said. The 29 others were injured. The two-section bus was just starting to cross Aurora Avenue Bridge, which spans the Lake Union ship canal, about 3:10 P.M. when the driver was shot by a passenger, the police said. The bus, heading south, jumped a lane of northbound traffic, hit a van, then crashed through a guardrail and fell 50 feet, landing upright in an apartment garden in the Fremont district, an area of residential buildings, restaurants and businesses. Police officers did not disclose a motive for the shooting. They said that two people were involved, and that the second person was among the injured taken to the hospital. The gun was recovered at the hospital, the police said. Witnesses described a scene of panic as people with broken bones and bleeding cuts tried to crawl out of the bus. Rescue officials pulled out several people who were stuck in the bus. Mr. Badgley said he had seen two injured people on the roof of the apartments. When aid units arrived, they gave emergency treatment to people who could be seen on the apartment roof. All the passengers were injured, fire department officials said. Fifteen of the injured were in critical condition tonight and 10 were listed in serious condition, said a Fire Department spokeswoman, Sheila Strehle. The driver, whose name was not released by the police, was thrown from the bus, fire officials said.

Education Minister Hekia Parata announced yesterday that seclusion rooms would be banned in schools under new laws proposed by the government. Today, the ministry would not confirm or deny whether two schools were still using the rooms. The move to make the rooms illegal follows revelations some schools have been placing disruptive children in locked, small, cell-like rooms. Ms Parata told Parliament last month a Ministry of Education review found eight special schools had seclusion rooms. A response to written questions by the Green Party has now revealed only six of the schools have agreed to stop using them. RNZ understands the two schools in question were residential schools that operated 24/7. IHC's Trish Grant said the response was a cop-out. \"I'm concerned that the ministry is using phrases like 'working with the schools'. I think the minister herself said this was intolerable and needs to stop now.\" It was nonsense to blame the delay in shutting down the seclusion rooms on the high and complex needs of children, Ms Grant said. Plenty of research showed other ways to deal with high-needs children without locking them away, she said. Legislation to make seclusion rooms illegal had been included into an existing bill which was making its way through the House. This meant the law might not come into force until next year. Children's Commissioner Andrew Becroft said, in the meantime, the rooms must be decommissioned immediately. \"Without underestimating the difficulty of the challenges of volatile young people, the answer has got to be desist now, stop now. \"I don't think this is a phase-out situation, this is a cease and desist situation.\" The Ministry of Education has yet to report back on its review, which investigated the number of non-special schools that had or were using seclusion rooms. What about the other two schools? Ministry of Education Head of Special Education David Wales said these schools worked with children with some of the highest and most complex needs in the country, and staff constantly dealt with difficult and highly stressful situations. \"A small number, eight, told us they were using seclusion, and we have contacted them regularly to understand the circumstances in which the seclusion rooms may have been used inappropriately.\" Mr Wales said some schools, including one in central Auckland, had admitted using seclusion rooms. <sent> Both of these schools would continue to work closely with the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health as they implemented an implementation plan for the ban. \"The Ministry of Education has provided additional technical assistance to staff to help them support the implementation, and we continue to actively and regularly engage with schools to provide any further support required,\" Mr Wales said. \"We are not trying to remove seclusion from any school on this, but where there are instances of staff practising it inappropriately, as we have reported to parents, we will seek to provide a pathway out of it in a way that supports </sent>", "output": ["contacted them regularly to understand the circumstances in which the seclusion rooms may have been used inappropriately.\" Mr Wales said some schools, including one in central Auckland, had admitted using seclusion rooms.

In an interesting article in the Guardian (14 August) Nathan Thrall sets out the way in which many Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) activists now view the Israel-Palestinian conflict and how they pose a solution. An open letter (printed in full below) is being circulated which calls on Labour\u2019s National Executive to refuse to endorse the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) examples of antisemitism. Workers' Liberty thinks the Open Letter is based on a misunderstanding of the IHRA and thus will not help Labour's leadership deal with the resurgence of the IHRA-based problem of Palestine. The letter, entitled \u2018Call to the Labour Party\u2019s National Committee not to endorse the IHRA examples of antisemitism\u2019 (the pdf is here), is being circulated as part of the ongoing struggle for Palestinian rights and justice. The debate is not new. <sent> The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement in Europe (BDS) and the US had taken an increasingly unapologetic stance since the 1990s, especially at universities and in left-wing media but it has continued to struggle during the last seven years with what it regards as pro-Israeli forces on campus. Among BDS activists the pro-Israeli camp has a few high profile opponents whose cases and their anti-Palestinian stances in certain circles have been widely publicized or that have caused significant outrage. One of these is Professor Gershom Gorenstein, who last year published an article that was widely ridiculed on Twitter, where he claims that the US\u2019s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel\ufffd </sent>", "output": ["resurgence of the IHRA-based problem of Palestine.

Another was a $2,180 shotgun, gifted to UAW Vice President Norwood Jewell by King in 2015 for his birthday. After discovering the firearm was gifted using stolen funds, Jewell reimbursed the union for the cost. Jewell has not been publicly named as part of the investigation at this time.\n\"We have thoroughly investigated the matter and concluded that Norwood Jewell did nothing illegal and has acted in line with the UAW's ethical practices,\" the UAW said in a separate statement.\nThe financial trail of Jewell's top administrative assistant, Nancy Johnson, is also under federal investigation, The Detroit News reported.

That amount rose to $4.5 million in stolen funds, according to a plea deal for a third official charged in the conspiracy.\nThe case has led to criminal charges against three others: former Fiat Chrysler executive Alphons Iacobelli, former FCA financial analyst Jerome Durden and Monica Morgan, the wife of Jewell's predecessor, General Holiefield.\nThe head of the Detroit FBI, David Gelios, said \"years of fraud and corruption within a select group of the FCA and UAW hierarchy continue to be eroded through the diligence and collaboration of law enforcement.\"\nFCA CEO Sergio Marchionne said last month the \"deplorable\" conduct \"had nothing whatsoever to do with the collective bargaining process.\" The company also said in July that the \"egregious acts were neither known to nor sanctioned by (Fiat Chrysler),\" and declined to elaborate on Friday.\nThe document released Friday outlines how credit cards tied to the training center funds were distributed to UAW executives. In December 2012, Holiefield allegedly told King that Iacobelli did not have a problem with them using their NTC credit cards to purchase personal items \"if we see something we want.\"\nIn February 2012, Durden directed that payments to credit cards were to be \"screened\" from the members of the NTC accounting staff, and changed the security settings of the center's accounting software to further conceal payments", "gen_completion": " and access the funds.\n\"King was also involved in approving some expenses for Iacobelli, including the use of credit cards to pay home renovation costs, jewelry, personal items, and purchases at department stores,\" the indictment said.\n\"It was not until April 2012 that a full investigation was launched,\" the indictment notes.\nAuthorities first questioned Holiefield in 2016, after the charges against him were brought.

Virdell King, a retired UAW associate director, was charged in a 17-page document with using a credit card from a training center for Chrysler employees to buy more than $40,000 worth of clothing, jewelry, luggage and other personal items for herself and other senior UAW officials. King, 65, who is known the first African-American female to be elected president of a local union in UAW-Chrysler's history, was charged in U.S. District Court on Friday in the information document, indicating that she is likely cooperating and working on a plea deal with the government. A lawyer for King, John Shea, declined to comment Friday. Among the purchases for herself was a pair of Christian Louboutin shoes for more than $1,000, authorities said. Another was a $2,180 shotgun, gifted to UAW Vice President Norwood Jewell by King in 2015 for his birthday. After discovering the firearm was gifted using stolen funds, Jewell reimbursed the union for the cost. Jewell has not been publicly named as part of the investigation at this time. \"We have thoroughly investigated the matter and concluded that Norwood Jewell did nothing illegal and has acted in line with the UAW's ethical practices,\" the UAW said in a separate statement. The financial trail of Jewell's top administrative assistant, Nancy Johnson, is also under federal investigation, The Detroit News reported. Allegedly, her training center credit card was also used to buy luxury designer goods, the newspaper reported. FCA executives partnered with UAW leaders to siphon funds earmarked for employee training for personal use, a federal indictment alleged. The 42-page document outlines a $2.2 million dollar conspiracy, charging UAW and FCA officials embezzled funds for lavish gifts and home renovation. That amount rose to $4.5 million in stolen funds, according to a plea deal for a third official charged in the conspiracy. The case has led to criminal charges against three others: former Fiat Chrysler executive Alphons Iacobelli, former FCA financial analyst Jerome Durden and Monica Morgan, the wife of Jewell's predecessor, General Holiefield. The head of the Detroit FBI, David Gelios, said \"years of fraud and corruption within a select group of the FCA and UAW hierarchy continue to be eroded through the diligence and collaboration of law enforcement.\" FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne said last month the \"deplorable\" conduct \"had nothing whatsoever to do with the collective bargaining process.\" The company also said in July that the \"egregious acts were neither known to nor sanctioned by (Fiat Chrysler),\" and declined to elaborate on Friday. The document released Friday outlines how credit cards tied to the training center funds were distributed to UAW executives. In December 2012, Holiefield allegedly told King that Iacobelli did not have a problem with them using their NTC credit cards to purchase personal items \"if we see something we want.\" In February 2012, Durden directed that payments to credit cards were to be \"screened\" from the members of the NTC accounting staff, and changed the security settings of the center's accounting software to further conceal payments King also used Iacobelli's credit card for personal expenses, the document said.

HR training objectives support this role by educating employees and managers on the relevant procedures. Training objectives focus on what the organization needs to achieve and how to help employees attain company goals. Depending on the type of business and specific challenges the company faces, there are a wide range of possible HR training objectives. However, some are important in almost every organization.\nEvery employer has a duty to provide a safe and healthy working environment. Every employee has a duty to protect himself and those around him. Health and safety is an area that is often included as part of the HR function in small and medium-sized companies. In large organizations, there may be a dedicated health and safety department. Managers need to be trained in risk assessments and the importance of undertaking them regularly and correctly, while implementing any necessary actions quickly. Neglecting this duty can lead to injury, illness, death and legal action against the company. All of these have significant financial costs that may put the company\u2019s future at risk. As all staff must be made aware of health and safety issues and company policies, this is a significant ongoing training objective for every company.\nCompanies avoid unlawful behaviors and potential lawsuits by ensuring all staff are aware of the basic legal requirements regarding equalities and have an understanding of the benefits of diversity. Equality training equips managers to work within the legal structure and avoid discrimination in recruitment and how they treat staff. A diverse workforce brings many advantages to a company including a range of skills and ideas. However, it is important that everyone is able to communicate effectively with a desire to work together. HR training in diversity can help staff make the most of their working relationships and develop new insights into how the business interacts with its customers and the wider community.\nBeing able to manage staff effectively is essential for every manager.

Health and safety is an area that is often included as part of the HR function in small and medium-sized companies. In large organizations, there may be a dedicated health and safety department. Managers need to be trained in risk assessments and the importance of undertaking them regularly and correctly, while implementing any necessary actions quickly. Neglecting this duty can lead to injury, illness, death and legal action against the company. All of these have significant financial costs that may put the company\u2019s future at risk. As all staff must be made aware of health and safety issues and company policies, this is a significant ongoing training objective for every company. Companies avoid unlawful behaviors and potential lawsuits by ensuring all staff are aware of the basic legal requirements regarding equalities and have an understanding of the benefits of diversity. Equality training equips managers to work within the legal structure and avoid discrimination in recruitment and how they treat staff. A diverse workforce brings many advantages to a company including a range of skills and ideas. However, it is important that everyone is able to communicate effectively with a desire to work together. HR training in diversity can help staff make the most of their working relationships and develop new insights into how the business interacts with its customers and the wider community. Being able to manage staff effectively is essential for every manager. This includes how to run recruitment campaigns and choose the right people; supervise them and maximize their performance; maintain good employee relations; and build teams. While complex issues can be handed over to an HR manager, day-to-day staff management is the responsibility of line managers who are expected to deliver high performance. There are many potential training objectives and activities available to an HR department to help them train their managers. These include how to deliver and coach training, what the training should cover, what the managers\u2019 roles and responsibilities should be, and how to help employees perform at their best. The training objectives and activities included in a company\u2019s personnel policies or human resources manual can also be used to create an action plan to work towards achieving the goals over the following years. Management at all levels should also ensure they have access to the latest employee engagement data.

Clean lines, lean cockpit, naturally-aspirated and a manual transmission\u2013seems pretty much as perfect as a Porsche could get in 2019. Powered by a naturally-aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six from the 911 GT3 and 911 GT3 RS, the $274,500 Speedster will get individual throttle bodies which is supposed to aggressively sharpen the response of the engine\u2019s claimed 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. This car is built around a chassis \u201cderived from the 911 GT3 models with a specifically-calibrated rear axle steering system and dynamic engine mounts to deliver a maximum amount of precision, stability and driving pleasure,\u201d per a press release, and Porsche\u2019s promising a 192-mph top speed and a stopped-to-60 mph time of 3.8 seconds. Besides the obvious exterior tweaks setting the Speedster apart from any other 911\u2013those being the squat appearance thanks to its ultra-raked windshield and low rear hatch\u2013this car\u2019s been treated to extensive lightweighting. The frunk, front fenders, and rear deck lid are all \u201cmade from carbon fiber composite material\u201d while the front and rear bumpers are polyurethane. The interior door panels are lean, and the car\u2019s standard option loadout omits air conditioning, though you can spec it for free if you must. Speedster owners will also have to slum it with a cloth top that closes manually [gasp] in the name of weight savings. The six-speed manual transmission saves \u201cabout nine pounds\u201d over a Porsche seven-speed, and 40 pounds over a PDK automatic, as if you needed another excuse to go with three pedals. All those tricks are supposed to slim the Speedster\u2019s curb weight down to 3,230 pounds. So, basically, \u201ca GT3 Touring with a roof delete,\u201d as Jalopnik contributor Bradley Brownell pointed out. He also speculates the cars will be selling for half a million bucks by next summer. And, yeah, probably. 2019 Speedster owners will also be able to get an \u201cexclusive watch,\u201d sorry, timepiece, if they buy the car. It looks like the wheel of the car and the strap is apparently made of the same leather Porsche uses to make its interiors. I have no strong feelings about it one way or another. Back in 2018 Porsche teased a new sleek Speedster concept, taking design cues and a lithe aesthetic from the company\u2019s flagship Taycan. The first production model based on the concept is expected to have the latest in digital and telematics technology, along with an all-new battery pack, but it\u2019ll also be a hybrid sports car, albeit one whose shape is derived from the 718 Carrera. And the Taycan is expected to top out at about 155 mph. The Speedster is also expected to cost well over $200,000, which is about ten times the price of a base GT3. <sent> The company didn\u2019t specify what that price is, though I guess it\u2019ll be at least similar to Porsche\u2019s \u201cequivalent\u201d 911 GT3 R, based on the current 918 Spyder.

Over the weekend, Trump told a \"60 Minutes\" interviewer the issue of legal abortion then would be decided on a state level, and some women would have to \"go to another state\" to obtain an abortion. Walsh noted others within the GOP may want to cut off money to states who support reproductive rights if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Asked what he could do currently as mayor to protect women\u2019s reproductive rights, Walsh said, \"Working with the legislature to make sure the laws don\u2019t get weakened. Working with health centers to make sure that, if there\u2019s there\u2019s threats of cutting back federal funding to those health centers for any type of reproductive rights, working with all the health centers in the city of Boston to make sure there is an open-door policy. The mayor warned of the lasting negative impacts a Trump presidency could have. \u201cI have never had a feeling on the streets like I do today,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cThe pro-Trump people are all excited about him being elected, but imagine what could happen, the damage that could be happen, if if the decision is reversed. We don\u2019t stand for that.\u201d The mayor said he intends to get more information at his election night party about how Trump will handle abortion rights. He said he supports efforts to keep abortion clinics like the one at the Papworth Health Center in Boston open. \u201cIf there\u2019s any movement to weaken the regulations from the state level, I think it\u2019s important that those health centers know that, even if there is a funding cut, that the patients can get care any day of the week that they need it.

Then he discovered that in Vietnam, too, they play tag and hide-and-seek, and he started to make friends. But Vietnamese is devilishly hard to master. Although its alphabet is Romanized, it has six distinct tones, each of which can change the meaning of a word. The tones are what give the language its singsong musicality. Americans started arriving in Vietnam in the 1990s as the country sought, like China, to open up to market forces without abandoning communist one-party rule. Some, like the Huffs, came to work with children. Others came to do business. After signing a pact normalizing trade relations in 2001, the United States and Vietnam last year had record two-way trade totaling about $2 billion. Companies like Nike have turned \u201cMade in Vietnam\u201d into a fixture in American malls, and Vietnam ships a lot of seafood to the U.S. market. Today, an estimated 2,700 Americans live in Vietnam, mostly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, which both offer international schools. Danang in central Vietnam, 470 miles south of Hanoi, doesn\u2019t have that option. So Alex\u2019s three-story school next to an old Buddhist temple is an open-air affair with no air conditioning to keep the heat and humidity at bay. Danang was a base from which American warplanes took off for combat during the Vietnam War. Viet Cong guerrillas regularly rocketed the Marines\u2019 helicopter base a few miles to the south. Now the streets that once teemed with U.S. soldiers offer everything from Internet cafes to tour companies and clothing shops. The city of 700,000 is a constant symphony of construction noise, swarms of beeping motorbikes and people chatting or eating on the sidewalks. Overlooking China Beach, once a favorite for GIs on leave, is the five-star Furama Resort hotel with marble floors and tiled swimming pools. Yet Danang maintains a small-town charm. A typical sight is schoolgirls on bicycles wearing the traditional ao dais, a flowing white tunic. Alex says he feels most at home in Vietnam. Le Nguyen Van Anh and Alex were when they first met, in kindergarten. She told him he had a lot of grammatical errors and should watch his pronunciation, but he wouldn\u2019t listen. In 2005, he took second place in a storytelling contest called the Vien Viet Nhan Dan, or \u201cStorytelling Competition.\u201d The contest is held annually in several cities and is a competition in the country\u2019s oldest language, spoken in a few isolated villages despite the country\u2019s rapid modernization.

When news of the anti-Semitic vandalism surfaced, the rabbi immediately received a visit from one of his closest friends.\nA world-renowned Evangelical pastor, Hagee\u2019s telecasts on Global Evangelism Television reach over 150 million homes in the United States. These days, Hagee may be equally well known for his support of Israel and the Jewish people.\nNearly ten years ago, Hagee founded Christian United For Israel. Today, CUFI is the largest pro-Israel organization in the world with over 2.5 million members. But without Rabbi Scheinberg, there would never have been a CUFI and nearly $100 million raised to help the people of Israel.\nSitting with the pastor, the rabbi, and CUFI Communications Director Ari Morgenstern, the love and joy in the room were undeniable. Exchanging beaming smiles that lit up the room, Hagee and Scheinberg greet each other and embrace with a hug that could break a rib.\nThe pastor and rabbi first met in 1981.

And if we hadn\u2019t been successful in that first meeting, $95 million for humanitarian causes would never have been donated to Israel,\u201d said Hagee.\nAfter that first Night to Honor Israel, Rabbi Scheinberg began accompanying the pastor and his congregation on trips to Israel.\nHagee\u2019s motives have been questioned ever since his first outreach to the Jewish community nearly", "gen_completion": " a decade ago. Critics have questioned why Jews like himself were using the charitable outreach of Christians for an ideological purpose.\n\u201cI understand and respect Hagee\u2019s motives.

At the epicenter of the rampage sits Congregation Rodfei Sholom, an Orthodox synagogue that is the spiritual home for over 300 families, led by Rabbi Aryeh Scheinberg. When news of the anti-Semitic vandalism surfaced, the rabbi immediately received a visit from one of his closest friends. A world-renowned Evangelical pastor, Hagee\u2019s telecasts on Global Evangelism Television reach over 150 million homes in the United States. These days, Hagee may be equally well known for his support of Israel and the Jewish people. Nearly ten years ago, Hagee founded Christian United For Israel. Today, CUFI is the largest pro-Israel organization in the world with over 2.5 million members. But without Rabbi Scheinberg, there would never have been a CUFI and nearly $100 million raised to help the people of Israel. Sitting with the pastor, the rabbi, and CUFI Communications Director Ari Morgenstern, the love and joy in the room were undeniable. Exchanging beaming smiles that lit up the room, Hagee and Scheinberg greet each other and embrace with a hug that could break a rib. The pastor and rabbi first met in 1981. At the time, Hagee approached the Jewish Federation in San Antonio about his desire to host a Night to Honor Israel. \u201cThe Jewish community was vetting me out of concerns about my agenda,\u201d Hagee explained. I asked how CUFI\u2019s work would be impacted today if Scheinberg hadn\u2019t given his blessing to Hagee\u2019s idea. \u201cThere would never have been a Night to Honor Israel or a Christians United For Israel that now has over 2.5 million members. And if we hadn\u2019t been successful in that first meeting, $95 million for humanitarian causes would never have been donated to Israel,\u201d said Hagee. After that first Night to Honor Israel, Rabbi Scheinberg began accompanying the pastor and his congregation on trips to Israel. Hagee\u2019s motives have been questioned ever since his first outreach to the Jewish community nearly ten years ago. \u201cPeople have questioned why Jews like me have used the humanitarian assistance of Christians for an agenda,\u201d the rabbi acknowledged. \u201cI respect his motives and I respect the good he has done for the Jewish people,\u201d Scheinberg added. \u201cHis motives are not bad,\u201d the rabbi continued. \u201cBut, what he\u2019s done is open up Christians to Jews in a way that only benefits the Jewish people.\u201d But, Scheinberg explained, it\u2019s only through knowing Christians that Jews can learn the truth about what Christians really believe. \u201cKnowing the truth starts with knowing your brother and sister,\u201d Scheinberg said. <sent> Because if you know your brothers and sisters, it\u2019s natural for you to look after them,\u201d said Rabbi Scheinberg.

The meeting took place near the end of that time, in April 2015. The meeting was ostensibly set up to discuss Torshin\u2019s new appointment as deputy central bank governor. The timing of this meeting seems significant. By this time, Russia had annexed Crimea more than a year earlier, and overtly invaded eastern Ukraine seven months prior to the meeting. Sanctions had already been applied to Russia, but Obama still wanted to pursue friendlier ties. Torshin\u2019s meeting with Fischer could be explained as a way to coordinate banking systems, but sending an undersecretary of state to a meeting with Torshin signals something more significant. However, the streak of presidential na\u00efvet\u00e9 on Vladimir Putin didn\u2019t start there, and it didn\u2019t end there either. Butina\u2019s presence as a potential spy is certainly interesting, but so is Torshin\u2019s, who also figures into the \u201cit was the NRA\u2019s fault\u201d narrative. If the Obama administration was granting her and Torshin access to the Undersecretary for International Affairs, it\u2019s tough to blame the NRA or the GOP for a lack of due diligence in engaging with either one of them. Torshin didn\u2019t end up on a sanctions list until April of this year, long after the NRA distanced themselves from him. Lieu, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre in March, expressing his concern with the NRA\u2019s relationship to Torshin and noting that Torshin \u201cacted as a liaison\u201d during a December 2015 visit to Moscow by several NRA attended by board members. How deeply disturbing is it, then, that the Obama administration had made itself available to Torshin eight months earlier? Or that it allowed a potential honey-trap spy like Butina to be in the same room as a high Official? One person familiar with the meeting told Vice News he was quite surprised at the meeting\u2019s timing. According to the CNI report, Sheets told Butina that he had \u201cgreat relations\u201d with Torshin but that they \u201chad never discussed\u201d Russia, because \u201che hates the US.\u201d But Torshin also pushed Butina on the NRA\u2019s political agenda, trying to help her \u201cunlearn everything about US politics\u201d that she had learned in American-funded college programs. <sent> She managed to dismiss Torshin\u2019s comments as \u201cdumb,\u201d the report said. She also rejected an invitation to come to Washington to conduct outreach to the NRA and the American business sector.

The sound of helplessness in your voices has permeated my subconscious all week.\nI wish we could help all of you. I wish that every person who\u2019s drowning under a mountain of medical debt right now could be helped by this program we\u2019ve started. But that sad reality is that with nearly one in four Americans struggling with medical bills right now, we are barely scratching the surface by paying off bills for a mere 600 of you.\nIf there is one thing I have learned this week it\u2019s this, the current state of our nation\u2019s healthcare system is as broken as some of the dozens of people who have called to talk this week.\nThere was James Glasscock who emailed on Tuesday. James nearly lost his sight a few years ago in an accident. He was hospitalized for a week and was eventually sent a bill for $398,999.98. How many people could afford to pay a bill like that?\nJames went on to say that he\u2019s doing the best he can to make ends meet. Like so many others he does not qualify for Medicare coverage. Even if he did, it wouldn\u2019t erase the hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt he owes. James\u2019 wife works full time and he\u2019s started driving for Uber just so they can put food on the table.\nThere\u2019s another common theme that\u2019s emerged this week as I\u2019ve sat here listening to your stories.

(WTVF) \u2014 In the dozens of calls, hundreds of emails I\u2019ve received since we launched \u201cMedical Debt Rescue,\u201d there is the one constant: desperation. The sound of helplessness in your voices has permeated my subconscious all week. I wish we could help all of you. I wish that every person who\u2019s drowning under a mountain of medical debt right now could be helped by this program we\u2019ve started. But that sad reality is that with nearly one in four Americans struggling with medical bills right now, we are barely scratching the surface by paying off bills for a mere 600 of you. If there is one thing I have learned this week it\u2019s this, the current state of our nation\u2019s healthcare system is as broken as some of the dozens of people who have called to talk this week. There was James Glasscock who emailed on Tuesday. James nearly lost his sight a few years ago in an accident. He was hospitalized for a week and was eventually sent a bill for $398,999.98. How many people could afford to pay a bill like that? James went on to say that he\u2019s doing the best he can to make ends meet. Like so many others he does not qualify for Medicare coverage. Even if he did, it wouldn\u2019t erase the hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt he owes. James\u2019 wife works full time and he\u2019s started driving for Uber just so they can put food on the table. There\u2019s another common theme that\u2019s emerged this week as I\u2019ve sat here listening to your stories.

Judd Apatow's comments (per The Wrap) are both good and bad for fans of the show. Apatow not ruling out the possibility of a reunion someday gives us reason to be optimistic, and dropping the news in January that 2016 won\u2019t be the year for a reunion can keep us from wondering about the possibilities. Still, word that a reunion won\u2019t be anytime soon is a bummer. We can at least count on the fact that Apatow would certainly be willing to bring the cast back for another go. Although he's (assumedly) joking about the Franco thing, if any actor were capable of putting together a reunion without actually telling anybody else involved in the original, it would be James Franco. Franco played stoner heartthrob Daniel Desario during the single season of Freaks and Geeks; unlike many other film stars who got their starts young on TV, Franco loves to talk about his past show. His AOL web series Making A Scene even featured a musical mashup between Freaks and Geeks and Saved by the Bell, because of course it did. Judd Apatow and James Franco aren\u2019t the only Freaks and Geeks alums still harboring a certain degree of resentment about the cancellation. Despite his success on the big screen, Seth Rogen didn\u2019t hesitate to have the former Freaks and Geeks stars join him and a third comedian for a screening of a documentary about the show at the Sundance film festival in 2012. After Franco and his guest made their peace on camera, Rogen and Franco did a whole-cast reunion, which Apatow still wants to happen. <sent> [via The Wrap] Follow the Bangor Daily News on Facebook for the latest Maine news.

In 2016, it was also the first aquarium to hatch and raise a giant sea bass. Other industry firsts include reproducing zebra sharks through artificial insemination, drawing a voluntary blood sample from a sea otter and developing large-scale touch exhibits for moon jellies and sharks. Edi and Edison, the massive blue whale models seen \u201cfloating\u201d above aquarium visitors in the great hall, were designed and built by the Larson Company in Tucson, Arizona, and transported to Long Beach in seven pieces. Today, 11,000 animals live at the aquarium and is the nation\u2019s fourth most attended. During peak season, over 400 employees and a volunteer corps of over 1,600 run the popular destination. The aquarium installed its first webcams around 2001 in three exhibits. Today, there are eight webcams, including a seasonal one that was just made live in the penguin nursery (check it out here) where you can watch Magellanic Penguin chicks generally being their cute, fluffy selves, flapping their wings and more at any given time of day from your phone or computer. The aquarium offers a guide for citizens to build a more climate-resilient Long Beach, based on its collaborative effort with Southern California-based universities, regional and city government and local businesses. It also recently launched a series of courses that teach visitors about the concepts of sustainable living, like food, energy and transportation. \u201cSustainability is not only a core value of the aquarium, it is also a core part of our mission,\u201d Schubel said. The aquarium has also become a leader in ocean conservation through its establishment of Long Beach Lab, a long-term science program, and the Ocean Heroes Sea-Life Center, a research facility and education center. <sent> By 2050, the aquarium anticipates having an average audience of more than 8 million annually.

{"prefix": "Born Wet, Human Babies Are 75 Percent Water. Then Comes The Drying : Krulwich Wonders... A fresh tomato is 93.5 percent water. A fresh baby girl or boy is 75 percent water. A banana, 74 percent. We all start wet, and then, inevitably, dry. A 1-year-old baby carries 10 percent less water; a male adult 15 percent less. Life is a slow evaporation, with some curious exceptions.\nLovely, no? Now think of this baby abstractly \u2014 as a sack of hundreds of millions of atoms. Here's the atomic formula for a new human being, arranged by elements, according to scientist Neil Shubin.\nNotice that the two most plentiful atoms are H (hydrogen) and O (oxygen) which shouldn't be a big surprise, since 2 H's and an O make water, and we humans are very moist, especially when we're born.\nIt turns out, a brand new human baby is 75 percent water.\nWe're born as wet as a fresh potato. Tomatoes are wetter (93.5 percent water). Apples, too, but only slightly (80 percent). Check out this fruit vs. baby comparison.\nOK, we aren't as wet as watermelons (who'd want to be?), but still, we begin our lives as noisy dewdrops that will one day learn to crawl, then walk. As science writer Loren Eiseley once put it, people \"are a way that water has of going about, beyond the reach of rivers.\"\nBut then, with every step we take, we begin to dry. The longer we live, the drier we get. One year after birth, a human baby is only 65 percent water \u2013 a ten percent drop, says the U.S. Geological Survey.\nBabies are wetter than children. By the time we're adults, the USGS says, adult men are about 60 percent water, adult women 55 percent. Elderly people are roughly half water.\nThere are variations, of course. The more buff you are (muscle tissue stores more water) the wetter you are. Because women generally have more fat cells, they tend to be a bit drier. Fat cells aren't as moist.

Then Comes The Drying : Krulwich Wonders... A fresh tomato is 93.5 percent water. A fresh baby girl or boy is 75 percent water. A banana, 74 percent. We all start wet, and then, inevitably, dry. A 1-year-old baby carries 10 percent less water; a male adult 15 percent less. Life is a slow evaporation, with some curious exceptions. Lovely, no? Now think of this baby abstractly \u2014 as a sack of hundreds of millions of atoms. Here's the atomic formula for a new human being, arranged by elements, according to scientist Neil Shubin. Notice that the two most plentiful atoms are H (hydrogen) and O (oxygen) which shouldn't be a big surprise, since 2 H's and an O make water, and we humans are very moist, especially when we're born. It turns out, a brand new human baby is 75 percent water. We're born as wet as a fresh potato. Tomatoes are wetter (93.5 percent water). Apples, too, but only slightly (80 percent). Check out this fruit vs. baby comparison. OK, we aren't as wet as watermelons (who'd want to be?), but still, we begin our lives as noisy dewdrops that will one day learn to crawl, then walk. As science writer Loren Eiseley once put it, people \"are a way that water has of going about, beyond the reach of rivers.\" But then, with every step we take, we begin to dry. The longer we live, the drier we get. One year after birth, a human baby is only 65 percent water \u2013 a ten percent drop, says the U.S. Geological Survey. Babies are wetter than children. By the time we're adults, the USGS says, adult men are about 60 percent water, adult women 55 percent. Elderly people are roughly half water. There are variations, of course. The more buff you are (muscle tissue stores more water) the wetter you are. Because women generally have more fat cells, they tend to be a bit drier. Fat cells aren't as moist. The water that lubricates your joints, flushes your waste (I'm talking about pee), assists seminal reproduction, and absorbs shocks to your bones \u2014 as you age, the moisturizer in you slowly dwindles. And the odd thing is, our wet parts aren't where you'd think. I figured if some giant fist were to plunge out of the sky and squeeze a human like a sponge, the wettest bit would be our blood. That's wrong. Our brains, lungs, heart, liver and kidney contain the wettest tissue \u2014 between 65 and 85 percent water. Bones, of course, are driest, around 2 percent. So that's the essence. But how can an object that's mostly water be dry? There are two ways to think about wetness and dryness, when it comes to human physiology: Wet and dripping. The wetness of a person, or of a human body, is easy to understand. It's a highly saturated mixture, something you could walk on like a wet sidewalk or snow. Dripping is what happens when you pass through a high-speed stream of air. Air continually races across our skin, evaporating sweat, tears, and perspiration vapors. Dripping is a constant, continuous thing. If you get something solid wet, like snow, the water may evaporate, but you're still wet. It's wet or wet, both. Most of us enjoy wet things.

But by 2002 Brook and Fraser were under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office as their company collapsed owing \u00a3150m. Sue said: \u201cWe knew there was no future for them. I thought they would be a saviour but they went bust. We were worried. We started working with John Miller from English Heritage Trust but we couldn\u2019t get charitable status. We started on a feasability study and got Nick Gillibrand, a conservation architect, to look at plans for the building.We were looking at changing some of the hotel into flats and having a cafe and restaurant donwstairs. The boarded up Midland hotel was a sorry sight. Urban Splash planned a full restoration combining the hotel\u2019s original art deco features with a modern makeover to attract the 21st century customer. Restoration work began in June 2005 and then in June 2008, the Midland finally reopened looking as good as ever. There were early teething troubles and guest complaints as Urban Splash proved to be far better at designing than they were at running a hotel. But today, now owned by the Lancaster Foundation charity and run day-to-day by English Lakes Hotels, the Midland is back to its very best and in great demand. The boarded up Midland hotel before it was renovated. Sue said: \u201cThe Friends have dissipated now but we have those memories and those links. Urban Splash wanted to knock down the two sets of gate pillars but you have to have things you can say \u2018look at what we\u2019ve got\u2019. We always felt insignificant compared to Urban Splash. \u201cWe got all our members to write letters to The Visitor objecting to Urban Splash building flats next to The Midland. Looking to the future Sue now hopes that the hotel will be run in the interests of the community.

The frozen methane clusters appeared on the East Coast last year. In August 2014, it was reported that 570 methane seeps clustered in approximately eight regions. Compared to carbon dioxide, methane is about 25 times more potent.\nThe latest research into methane plumes off the Pacific Northwest comes from the University of Washington. Scientists observed 168 methane plumes over the course of a decade.\nFrozen as is, the methane plumes are not dangerous to our environment. When they thaw and come to the surface, however, the methane bubbles become a powerful and dangerous greenhouse gas. At the rate these plumes are coming to the surface, our atmosphere could be filled with.1 million metric tons of methane per year, just from the plumes off the Washington coast.\nIn the past, scientists focused on methane plumes in the Arctic, as well as increasing water temperatures on the ocean\u2019s surfaces. The recent data on methane plumes shows that deep water has had significant temperature spikes due to climate change.\nLuckily, much of the methane is eaten up by bacteria or converted into carbon dioxide.

This isn\u2019t the first time warm water temperatures have forced methane to the surface. The frozen methane clusters appeared on the East Coast last year. In August 2014, it was reported that 570 methane seeps clustered in approximately eight regions. Compared to carbon dioxide, methane is about 25 times more potent. The latest research into methane plumes off the Pacific Northwest comes from the University of Washington. Scientists observed 168 methane plumes over the course of a decade. Frozen as is, the methane plumes are not dangerous to our environment. When they thaw and come to the surface, however, the methane bubbles become a powerful and dangerous greenhouse gas. At the rate these plumes are coming to the surface, our atmosphere could be filled with.1 million metric tons of methane per year, just from the plumes off the Washington coast.

It is a low-investment, high-impact way of raising your profile online.\nMike Peates, founder and director of the homemade chocolate business Owow Chocolate has focused on turning his customers into brand advocates from the start.\nWhen his business was starting up, Peates focused more on engaging than selling and was relentless on social media. He sent packs of chocolate to people he\u2019d been talking to and encouraged them to share their thoughts on Twitter.\nThis worked particularly well, largely because the business makes branded chocolate gifts and his target market are other small firms who use them for promotion and client rewards. His customers help him promote his business, while his whole business focuses on promoting theirs.\nYou can create opportunities for engagement in many ways. Encourage your customers to get involved in social media competitions, ask them to show you what they love about your product or simply tap into their personal life and encourage them to share their interests.\nAt Bozboz we ran a Mother\u2019s Day competition on Facebook for one of our clients, an airline company based in Africa. We asked people to send in a picture of their mother and explain what made their relationship special. Thousands of people entered for a chance to win flights on a route our client was keen to promote. As a result, we were left with thousands of images of happy customers, which we could then use in marketing material for the airline.\nBut be aware: you need to obtain permission to use any images, even if they have been sent to you.\nThe psychological phenomenon of \u201csocial proof\u201d, which says that people are drawn to a product or service that they know others are already engaging with, is a pivotal part of marketing.

It is a low-investment, high-impact way of raising your profile online. Mike Peates, founder and director of the homemade chocolate business Owow Chocolate has focused on turning his customers into brand advocates from the start. When his business was starting up, Peates focused more on engaging than selling and was relentless on social media. He sent packs of chocolate to people he\u2019d been talking to and encouraged them to share their thoughts on Twitter. This worked particularly well, largely because the business makes branded chocolate gifts and his target market are other small firms who use them for promotion and client rewards. His customers help him promote his business, while his whole business focuses on promoting theirs. You can create opportunities for engagement in many ways. Encourage your customers to get involved in social media competitions, ask them to show you what they love about your product or simply tap into their personal life and encourage them to share their interests. At Bozboz we ran a Mother\u2019s Day competition on Facebook for one of our clients, an airline company based in Africa. We asked people to send in a picture of their mother and explain what made their relationship special. Thousands of people entered for a chance to win flights on a route our client was keen to promote. As a result, we were left with thousands of images of happy customers, which we could then use in marketing material for the airline. But be aware: you need to obtain permission to use any images, even if they have been sent to you. The psychological phenomenon of \u201csocial proof\u201d, which says that people are drawn to a product or service that they know others are already engaging with, is a pivotal part of marketing. So appointing brand ambassadors, people who genuinely like your brand, is a great way to spread your message.

A way to harness and apply a disciplined approach to managing symptoms? Too often we equate discipline with punishment or control. But The American Heritage Dictionary offers the first definition of discipline as training expected to produce a specific character or pattern of behavior, especially training that produces moral or mental improvement.

Uber's move to join the International Association of Public Transportation (UITP) is part of a drive by Uber to improve its relationships with local authorities after a series of regulatory and legal setbacks. UITP represents public transport providers around the world, including Transport for London (TfL) - which in September stripped Uber of its operating license. Scandal-hit Uber has just had to reassure authorities it is changing the way it does business after the disclosure of a massive data breach cover-up that has prompted investigations from regulators around the world. Andrew Salzberg, Uber's head of transportation policy and research, said aligning the company with public transport authorities was a good way to make Uber a better partner for cities. Uber, currently valued at $69 billion, has been testing a more collaborative approach to regulators under its new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a shift away from a more aggressive culture under former CEO Travis Kalanick. \"One of the big emphases that Dara has made... is that we want to be better partners for the cities we operate in,\" Salzberg said. Uber said it would work on a series of training sessions with UITP aimed at connecting people better with public transport. Salzberg said the company also wanted to help reduce congestion on roads by encouraging people to move to shared modes of transport. Despite the effort, transport unions said there was no place for Uber in public transport. \"This initiative is not in keeping with the TfL culture, nor the public transport approach, which is characterized by an independent and customer-focused approach,\" said Peter Burdett, general secretary of the TSSA.

Paramount is releasing the film in the exact same corridor that brought success in the last couple of years to two other, somewhat similar movies American Sniper and Lone Survivor, and like the latter film in particular, Bay has crafted a patriotic, riveting war movie full of intense action that also thankfully puts a human face on exactly what happened in Benghazi.\nretired Navy Seals and Marines now in their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, is basically a movie that puts its emphasis on the brave men who fought this battle rather than the ensuing political storm it is still causing as we enter this Presidential election year. Hillary Clinton and President Obama (not even mentioned) are not the focus here as in the political debate about what was done \u2013 or not done- in this incident. Rather, it is these six men who form a unit called Group Global Response or GGR there, to protect and provide security for whatever problems might come up. When U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens (Matt Letscher) goes out to visit the vulnerable outpost, a terrorist attack soon follows and he is killed, a victim of smoke inhalation, along with three others. With no American military in sight, the GGR tries to ride to the rescue but are thwarted by a superior named Bob ( David Costabile) and lose crucial time. Against his orders they go anyway. When they get there the place is in flames and the CIA Annex is likely the next target. What ensues is a very violent war film full of shooting and explosions, exactly the kind of thing we have come to expect from Bay films, but here in the context of a true story seems all too real, putting the audience right in the center of the action.\nIn many ways this movie, which really only wants to focus on the warrior, not the war, is like many others, but because it is likely to be used as a political football (and already has been on Fox News) the real point of it could be sadly lost. I hope it isn\u2019t because seeing this whole thing from the POV of the men who were on the front lines, much like The Alamo in some ways (there\u2019s even a reference to that), is compelling moviemaking and a real step forward into something a little more important than another Transformers movie for Bay.\nThe acting across the board is excellent with standouts being John Krasinski as a former Navy Seal who must abandon his family just one more time to take on an assignment he thought would be brief and uneventful.

{"prefix": "Above: Thinfilm's smart label tells you about your bottle of Johnnie Walker.\nPerhaps you have heard about smart homes and smart light bulbs. Meet the smart bottle.\nYes, one of our most interesting new technologies is going to ensure that we can drink a bottle of scotch with the utmost confidence that it\u2019s authentic. It will also give the scotch maker a way to engage more deeply with a consumer who might otherwise just toss that bottle away and never be heard from again. The smart bottle is part of the Internet of Things (IoT), or everyday objects that are connected to the Internet and have electronic brains.\nThinfilm Electronics is revealing its smart bottle in a deal with Diageo, the maker of the Johnnie Walker Blue Label brand of scotch. The smart bottle can verify for you that your 12-year-old bottle of scotch has never been opened before, and it can also connect via near-field communications to your smartphone.\nWith a smartphone app, you can learn some new things about your Johnnie Walker Blue Label, get personalized promotions, and communicate with the liquor company.\nThinfilm, based in Oslo, Norway, is showing off the smart bottle and the printed electronics that it developed for the bottle at the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona, Spain. The company recently announced a deal with Xerox that will enable Thinfilm to print billions of chips per year on tiny labels as part of its plan to track IoT devices.\nThinfilm has figured out how to print chips such as sensors on tags that can be attached to bottles. Using Thinfilm\u2019s OpenSense technology, a smart bottle can detect both the sealed and open state of the bottle. The tags and sensor information they contain will allow Diageo to send personalized communications to consumers who read the tags with their smartphones.\nThe project came from Diageo Technology Ventures, an experimental tech and investment arm of Diageo. The goal is to enable Diageo to send consumers targeted and timely marketing messages, whether at retail or after purchase.

Perhaps you have heard about smart homes and smart light bulbs. Meet the smart bottle. Yes, one of our most interesting new technologies is going to ensure that we can drink a bottle of scotch with the utmost confidence that it\u2019s authentic. It will also give the scotch maker a way to engage more deeply with a consumer who might otherwise just toss that bottle away and never be heard from again. The smart bottle is part of the Internet of Things (IoT), or everyday objects that are connected to the Internet and have electronic brains. Thinfilm Electronics is revealing its smart bottle in a deal with Diageo, the maker of the Johnnie Walker Blue Label brand of scotch. The smart bottle can verify for you that your 12-year-old bottle of scotch has never been opened before, and it can also connect via near-field communications to your smartphone. With a smartphone app, you can learn some new things about your Johnnie Walker Blue Label, get personalized promotions, and communicate with the liquor company. Thinfilm, based in Oslo, Norway, is showing off the smart bottle and the printed electronics that it developed for the bottle at the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona, Spain. The company recently announced a deal with Xerox that will enable Thinfilm to print billions of chips per year on tiny labels as part of its plan to track IoT devices. Thinfilm has figured out how to print chips such as sensors on tags that can be attached to bottles. Using Thinfilm\u2019s OpenSense technology, a smart bottle can detect both the sealed and open state of the bottle. The tags and sensor information they contain will allow Diageo to send personalized communications to consumers who read the tags with their smartphones. The project came from Diageo Technology Ventures, an experimental tech and investment arm of Diageo. The goal is to enable Diageo to send consumers targeted and timely marketing messages, whether at retail or after purchase. It can, for instance, send you cocktail recipes after you open the bottle.

This is also one of the most customizable mice we've ever seen and it's also a great performer. We recommend it to anybody looking to spend a lot of money on an input device for game. So, the RAT 9 comes with a lot of features we expect on a high end gaming mice these. That's a 5600 dpi laser sensor. That means it's very fast, very accurate. This is a wireless mouse, but Mad Catz does sell wired version for a little less. Now, this button right here lets you move through various dpi settings you can make the most more less sensitive as you're playing. You can also use the included driver's software to customize the settings, so you can really tweak and feel the mouse to exactly how you would like it, if you flip it over, you can see it done. At middle here, there is a series of weights that come upon this post. You can actually unscrew. There's cuff here to take the weights off and set the weight of the mouse you want it. That's actually a nice little feature and it really helps improve the overall feel of the mouse. The top of the posts are actually doubled as an Allen wrench with slots to adjust various points in the mouse to really make it feel good in your hand.

What's cool about this track is that you cannot only slide in new wrist pieces depending on the kind of feel you want there. You can also set them to be longer or shorter.

Though the characters are engaging and some of the ideas are more relevant than ever, the plot feels more like a hurried synopsis rather than an actual story. That makes the dramatic development suffer, which also makes it harder to care about the larger trilogy the movie is inevitability hoping to kick off. Rather than being absorbed in each new development, I mostly just wanted to skip to the end to see how everything worked out.\nThe plot feels like X-Men by way of current events, with a virus that kills 90 percent of children and gives the other 10 percent potentially dangerous powers. The surviving 10 percent are taken away from their parents and locked in camps, with the most dangerous ones killed outright.\nRuby, one of the \u201cdangerous ones\u201d who survived because she managed to hide her power, is about to be discovered when she escapes the camp. With the help of other teens who are also on the run from the government and bounty hunters, the group tries to survive their enemies and find out if there\u2019s any place safe enough to call home.\nGiven the stories that have popped up in the news over the past year, the early scenes in the camp are both particularly relevant and that much more chilling. The helplessness of the children and teens in the face of the guards is by far the most disturbing thing about the movie, and a more careful exploration of the idea of imprisoning children might have elevated the movie to profound, moving relevance.\nUnfortunately, the creative team had an entire novel\u2019s worth of plot to speed through. A painfully small number of Hollywood screenwriters seem to realize that novels and movies are structured almost entirely differently, and you do a story more justice by making the necessary adaptations rather than trying to simply shoehorn in the whole book.

Rating: PG-13 for violence including disturbing images and thematic elements. Screenplay by: Chad Hodge, based on the novel by Alexandra Bracken. Directed by: Jennifer Yuh Nelson. Starring: Amandla Stenberg, Mandy Moore, Gwendoline Christie, Harris Dickinson, Skylan Brooks, Miya Chech, Bradley Whitford and more. When will Hollywood finally realize that it takes more than just summarizing a novel to make a good movie script? That\u2019s the biggest flaw with \u201cThe Darkest Minds,\u201d the latest attempt at bringing young adult dystopian fiction to the big screen. Though the characters are engaging and some of the ideas are more relevant than ever, the plot feels more like a hurried synopsis rather than an actual story. That makes the dramatic development suffer, which also makes it harder to care about the larger trilogy the movie is inevitability hoping to kick off. Rather than being absorbed in each new development, I mostly just wanted to skip to the end to see how everything worked out. The plot feels like X-Men by way of current events, with a virus that kills 90 percent of children and gives the other 10 percent potentially dangerous powers. The surviving 10 percent are taken away from their parents and locked in camps, with the most dangerous ones killed outright. Ruby, one of the \u201cdangerous ones\u201d who survived because she managed to hide her power, is about to be discovered when she escapes the camp. With the help of other teens who are also on the run from the government and bounty hunters, the group tries to survive their enemies and find out if there\u2019s any place safe enough to call home. Given the stories that have popped up in the news over the past year, the early scenes in the camp are both particularly relevant and that much more chilling. The helplessness of the children and teens in the face of the guards is by far the most disturbing thing about the movie, and a more careful exploration of the idea of imprisoning children might have elevated the movie to profound, moving relevance. Unfortunately, the creative team had an entire novel\u2019s worth of plot to speed through. A painfully small number of Hollywood screenwriters seem to realize that novels and movies are structured almost entirely differently, and you do a story more justice by making the necessary adaptations rather than trying to simply shoehorn in the whole book. Screenwriter Chad Hodge unfortunately falls into the latter trap, condensing what must have been whole chapters into scenes so relatively brief they add little to the overall story. There\u2019 s room in today\u2019s filmmaking for a movie as good as this one, and a lot more of these ideas, but they need to be pushed forward. That\u2019s the biggest mistake with \u201cThe Darkest Minds,\u201d which tries to be too many things at once. What starts out as a plot that works in the novel form quickly morphs into something even less plausible on screen, which only adds to the impression that this is just a money-making stunt to launch a series.

{"prefix": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The senator leading the charge to revive a assault weapons ban conceded on Sunday, just days before hearings on gun control open, that winning Senate passage will be tough but said she has been assured she will have the chance to bring it up for a vote.\nPresident Barack Obama, who has made gun control a top priority after 20 children and six adults were killed by a gunman on December 14 at a Connecticut school, said in remarks published on Sunday that gun control advocates should take into account the views of rural Americans who use guns for hunting.\n\u201cPart of being able to move this forward is understanding the reality of guns in urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural areas,\u201d Obama told The New Republic magazine as he continued his administration\u2019s outreach to gun owners even as he seeks new gun restrictions.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein said Majority Leader Harry Reid has promised that even if the assault weapons ban is left out of a broader package intended to curb gun violence, she will have the opportunity to offer it as an amendment on the Senate floor.\nFeinstein introduced legislation last Thursday to ban military-style assault weapons like the one used by the gunman in last month\u2019s school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and high-capacity ammunition clips.\n\u201cThis has always been an uphill fight. This has never been easy. This is the hardest of the hard,\u201d Feinstein, a California Democrat, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d program.\n\u201cNow, will it (gun violence legislation) only be assault weapons? No, most likely. There will be a package put together. If assault weapons is left out of the package... I\u2019ve been assured by the majority leader I\u2019ll be able to do it as an amendment on the (Senate) floor, which is the way I did it in 1993,\u201d Feinstein added.\nFeinstein was referring to the previous U.S. assault weapon ban that she authored. That law expired in 2004 after 10 years in effect and Congress refused to extend it.\nNo major gun control legislation has made it through Congress in two decades in the face of opposition from the National Rifle Association and its gun rights allies.\nRepublicans generally oppose gun restrictions and many Democrats, particularly those representing rural areas, also support gun rights. Reid has been a long-time backer of gun rights.\nWayne LaPierre, chief executive officer and executive vice president of the Virginia-based NRA, is among the witnesses scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing on Wednesday on reducing gun violence.\nObama, in the magazine interview, said bridging a cultural divide in attitudes to gun ownership will be critical to his administration\u2019s push to curb gun violence.\n\u201cIf you grew up and your dad gave you a hunting rifle when you were 10, and you went out and spent the day with him and your uncles, and that became part of your family\u2019s traditions, you can see why you\u2019d be pretty protective of that,\u201d Obama said.\nObama", "gen_completion": " last year proposed banning some assault weapons which he said were designed for military use but which are also increasingly used by law enforcement and by civilians. The White House has estimated that only about 5 percent of the more than 7 million civilian-owners of assault weapons are in possession of the weapons that the FBI says can fire more rounds in less time. Feinstein backs the push to ban the most popular civilian-produced assault weapons like the AK-47.\nIn December the White House submitted its proposed assault weapons ban to Congress, but a majority of Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, have resisted it. Obama, however, has said he is willing to go down to the wire to secure the backing of Democrats.\nAsked whether she thinks the administration could prevail on Democrats to support its legislation, Feinstein appeared not to rule it out.\n\u201cThe president\u2019s made his point very clearly,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s made it forcefully.\u201d", "paraphrase_outputs": {"lex_40_order_100": {"final_input": "lexical = 40, order = 100 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The senator leading the charge to revive a assault weapons ban conceded on Sunday, just days before hearings on gun control open, that winning Senate passage will be tough but said she has been assured she will have the chance to bring it up for a vote. President Barack Obama, who has made gun control a top priority after 20 children and six adults were killed by a gunman on December 14 at a Connecticut school, said in remarks published on Sunday that gun control advocates should take into account the views of rural Americans who use guns for hunting. \u201cPart of being able to move this forward is understanding the reality of guns in urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural areas,\u201d Obama told The New Republic magazine as he continued his administration\u2019s outreach to gun owners even as he seeks new gun restrictions. Senator Dianne Feinstein said Majority Leader Harry Reid has promised that even if the assault weapons ban is left out of a broader package intended to curb gun violence, she will have the opportunity to offer it as an amendment on the Senate floor. Feinstein introduced legislation last Thursday to ban military-style assault weapons like the one used by the gunman in last month\u2019s school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and high-capacity ammunition clips. \u201cThis has always been an uphill fight. This has never been easy. This is the hardest of the hard,\u201d Feinstein, a California Democrat, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d program. \u201cNow, will it (gun violence legislation) only be assault weapons? No, most likely. There will be a package put together. If assault weapons is left out of the package... I\u2019ve been assured by the majority leader I\u2019ll be able to do it as an amendment on the (Senate) floor, which is the way I did it in 1993,\u201d Feinstein added. Feinstein was referring to the previous U.S. assault weapon ban that she authored. That law expired in 2004 after 10 years in effect and Congress refused to extend it. No major gun control legislation has made it through Congress in two decades in the face of opposition from the National Rifle Association and its gun rights allies. Republicans generally oppose gun restrictions and many Democrats, particularly those representing rural areas, also support gun rights. Reid has been a long-time backer of gun rights. Wayne LaPierre, chief executive officer and executive vice president of the Virginia-based NRA, is among the witnesses scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing on Wednesday on reducing gun violence. Obama, in the magazine interview, said bridging a cultural divide in attitudes to gun ownership will be critical to his administration\u2019s push to curb gun violence. \u201cIf you grew up and your dad gave you a hunting rifle when you were 10, and you went out and spent the day with him and your uncles, and that became part of your family\u2019s traditions, you can see why you\u2019d be pretty protective of that,\u201d Obama said. Obama last year proposed banning assault weapons, which he said were designed for military use but which are increasingly used by police and civilians. The White House has estimated that fewer than 5 percent of the nation\u2019s more than 7 million private gun owners own assault-style weapons with the rapid-fire capacity the FBI says can fire up to 30 rounds per second. Feinstein is seeking to ban the most popular assault-style weapons, including the AK-47. Since Obama sent his assault weapons proposal to Congress in December, Republicans have held firm, led by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Obama has said he is willing to work with Democrats on a deal.

The doctor-entrepreneur-vintner, best known for inventing the angioplasty balloon, runs the Thomas Fogarty Winery just a few miles uphill from his medtech incubator at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View.\nThe non-profit Fogarty Institute for Innovation is based around a simple concept: Making life easier for small or early stage medtech firms developing cutting-edge products or tools. In an interview with Fast Company, Fogarty decried what he saw as the increasing cost of American medical innovation, and said that small medical companies need a safe environment for growth similar to those of lower-overhead conventional tech startups.\nSince its founding in 2007, the Institute has helped about a dozen small medical companies launch. Back in June, the Institute announced its latest crop of participants. The five new companies are primarily centered around providing services for expectant parents or newborn children. Among them are a non-invasive sensor that records fetal vital signs, a device that prevents vaginal tearing during childbirth, and a sensor set for clinicians giving urgent care to newborns.\nFirst Pulse Medical: First Pulse manufactures one of the first attempts at a heart rate monitor for fetuses during labor and delivery. The monitor uses proprietary light sensors to track a fetus's heart rate and oxygenation.\nInPress Technologies: InPress is testing a single-use medical device which quickly and effectively treats postpartum hemorrhaging (PPH) as it happens by stimulating vaginal contractions. One woman dies from PPH every four minutes.\nMaterna Medical: Materna is conducting tests in Australia on an anti-vaginal tearing device for women giving birth. The mechanical dilator is inserted during the first stage of labor and is designed to prevent vaginal tearing or pelvic damage during childbirth.\nMedical Cue: Medical Cue's NeoCue system is a combination sensor set/workflow organizing tool for childbirth. The system automatically gives medical professionals key physiologic data and real-time decision guidance.\nPrescient Surgical: Prescient Surgical's Cleancision device prevents dangerous surgical wound infections. This Stanford University spin-off is targeting a very specific market--obese patients undergoing colorectal surgery.\nDuring our conversation, which jumped from Fogarty's anger at the press for publishing (in his opinion) to many scare stories about medical innovation to the interaction between his institute and the larger Silicon Valley tech scene, he said something interesting. \u201cThe venture capital community has largely avoided medical companies because of the expenses associated with it. There are also many other problems, but primarily they're regulatory. We need more clinical research [for products] in addition to basic research... What we're doing at the Institute is trying to solve these issues.\" Fogarty also added that the institute works with entrepreneurs in other highly regulated industries to trade best practices on navigating bureaucracy, which is a common hurdle for health startups.\nThere are fewer industries more highly regulated than the medical profession. While transport apps like Uber have to deal with byzantine local taxi bureaucracies, medical startups face the FDA--an organization that is both costly and inefficient to deal with. Fogarty, along with many other biotech innovators I've spoken to, complains that the FDA is inefficient when it comes to evaluating new technology. It's not that the FDA is hostile to innovation; rather, it's that agency bureaucrats don't keep up with new research.\nWhat the Fogarty Institute tries to do is to make the regulatory and fundraising parts of getting off the ground easier for young medtech firms.

Since its founding in 2007, the Institute has helped about a dozen small medical companies launch. Back in June, the Institute announced its latest crop of participants. The five new companies are primarily centered around providing services for expectant parents or newborn children. Among them are a non-invasive sensor that records fetal vital signs, a device that prevents vaginal tearing during childbirth, and a sensor set for clinicians giving urgent care to newborns. First Pulse Medical: First Pulse manufactures one of the first attempts at a heart rate monitor for fetuses during labor and delivery. The monitor uses proprietary light sensors to track a fetus's heart rate and oxygenation. InPress Technologies: InPress is testing a single-use medical device which quickly and effectively treats postpartum hemorrhaging (PPH) as it happens by stimulating vaginal contractions. One woman dies from PPH every four minutes. Materna Medical: Materna is conducting tests in Australia on an anti-vaginal tearing device for women giving birth. The mechanical dilator is inserted during the first stage of labor and is designed to prevent vaginal tearing or pelvic damage during childbirth. Medical Cue: Medical Cue's NeoCue system is a combination sensor set/workflow organizing tool for childbirth. The system automatically gives medical professionals key physiologic data and real-time decision guidance. Prescient Surgical: Prescient Surgical's Cleancision device prevents dangerous surgical wound infections. This Stanford University spin-off is targeting a very specific market--obese patients undergoing colorectal surgery. During our conversation, which jumped from Fogarty's anger at the press for publishing (in his opinion) to many scare stories about medical innovation to the interaction between his institute and the larger Silicon Valley tech scene, he said something interesting. \u201cThe venture capital community has largely avoided medical companies because of the expenses associated with it. There are also many other problems, but primarily they're regulatory. We need more clinical research [for products] in addition to basic research... What we're doing at the Institute is trying to solve these issues.\" Fogarty also added that the institute works with entrepreneurs in other highly regulated industries to trade best practices on navigating bureaucracy, which is a common hurdle for health startups. There are fewer industries more highly regulated than the medical profession. While transport apps like Uber have to deal with byzantine local taxi bureaucracies, medical startups face the FDA--an organization that is both costly and inefficient to deal with. Fogarty, along with many other biotech innovators I've spoken to, complains that the FDA is inefficient when it comes to evaluating new technology. It's not that the FDA is hostile to innovation; rather, it's that agency bureaucrats don't keep up with new research. What the Fogarty Institute tries to do is to make the regulatory and fundraising parts of getting off the ground easier for young medtech firms. Participating companies in the Innovation Cultivation incubator base themselves at the Institute and are given assistance with research and business development. They also get on-site advice from regulatory experts, as well as hands-on help from mentors experienced in medtech innovation. \u201cWe want to create a better business environment and a more transparent marketplace,\u201d Fogarty says. \u201cWe want to help companies go from an idea to a thriving business. When a small company can get its business going and start making money, it's great. But it's often too early to go to the venture capital community or to apply for a government grant.\u201d <sent> There are companies that want to go ahead with the idea and don't have support resources.\u201d To achieve these goals, Fogarty created a startup training program to help start-ups grow around the Fogarty Institute. The four-part program calls for building a \u201cvendor\u201d at a venture firm, a marketing firm, a professional services firm, and a marketing, PR and content design agency.

One such dispersal order was put in place following the stabbing of a 15-year-old boy in the city centre on Sunday, February 2. This meant officers could move on any groups hanging around in the city centre if it\u2019s suspected they could be a crime or anti-social behaviour threat.

So we asked the Commander of Coventry Police, Chief Superintendent Mike O&apos;Hara, why one was used on Sunday and what came of it. Q: Why was this stabbing deemed serious enough to put the dispersal order in place? A: The stabbing was deemed serious enough by the duty Inspector on the evening to put the order in place, due to the fact that groups were congregating in the area. The groups soon dispersed following increased police presence in the area. Q: Was the order actually used by officers on Sunday or Monday to move anyone along or did it result in any arrests? A: I cannot confirm at this stage the specific details of the use of the order, however, previous use of the dispersal power has proven very effective in removing problematic individuals from the city centre and preventing potential issues. Officers have utilised search powers on numerous individuals in the area resulting in a drugs arrest. Q: Is the use of dispersal orders something you are now considering using more often in the wake of incidents like this? A: The use of the dispersal power is a very useful tool for officers in dealing with groups of youths when they feel that the criteria apply and the St Michaels area is considered to be unsafe.

As a result, he said, 550 more caseworkers were hired, and with a $1,000 monthly pay raise, the department's 700 caseworker vacancies were quickly filled. Whitman also said the agency is seeing job performance improvements. The number of days that children are in foster care is declining, he said, and that\u2019s important because it means children aren\u2019t in foster care for years, and their parents don\u2019t fear they\u2019ll be taken away at any moment.
