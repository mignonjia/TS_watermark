The starting running back was ruled out for Sunday's preseason game against the Bengals after missing practice Thursday afternoon. According to the team, Greene is taking antibiotics to treat the infection, which was caught early. The team said it could not determine whether or not it is a staph infection because skin infections like his cannot be cultured. But a team spokesman said today that Greene is responding well to antibiotics and is expected back next week. The team clarified Ryan's explanation of Greene's infection. Earlier this week, Greene had calluses shaved off his feet and received a local anesthetic for that procedure. While that was being done, he asked about irritation on another part of his foot, later diagnosed as a \"standard, routine skin infection.\" Greene did not have pus or fluid in his foot as a result of the skin infection, the team said. But swelling and irritation can result from standing on an infected foot, which is why Greene must keep it elevated. He is in the building today. \"Nobody seems too concerned with it,\" Ryan said. Ryan also did not express concern with the infection spreading through the facility. \"You can eat off these floors,\" Ryan said. \"They clean it like crazy. We try everything we can to make sure that never happens. We've never had an issue like that and hopefully we never will.\" In Greene's absence, LaDainian Tomlinson will start at running back. Joe McKnight (head) is expected to be cleared to play, and rookie Bilal Powell may receive a heavier load of snaps as well. WR Plaxico Burress (left ankle) will carry a full load in Sunday's preseason game, Ryan said. The starters will play into the second quarter, until they reach a snap total the coaches are satisfied with. \"We\u2019re going to leave him in there,\" Ryan said. \"Let him get his feet under him and he\u2019ll be fine. If there was something weird about him coming out of the game, you would have seen it on tape, because he looked fine out there.\" Burress missed the Jets' preseason opener in Miami because of a sprained ankle he suffered the first day of practice, Aug. 15, last year. He was back to full participation by the third week of the regular season, which was the same day as the Jets' season opener at Detroit. RUSHING NOT COOKING The Jets were unable to establish the run in their opener, rushing for 40 yards on 24 carries, or an average of 1.8 yards per carry.

The accent is a clue to the question, for Robson sounds more Sydney than St John\u2019s Wood. MARTIN SAMUEL: How can you NOT blame Giles for English cricket's latest shambles? He is the Australian, born to an English mother, who will attempt to come to the rescue of our cricket at a time when it has been condemned to its lowest ebb by his fellow countrymen. He is a former \u2018enemy\u2019 now in our midst. It is not without irony that Robson\u2019s probable introduction at the highest level coincides with England\u2019s stated attempt to regain a more \u2018English\u2019 feel to the national team. Yet England will have no hesitation in making him Alastair Cook\u2019s opening partner for the first Test against Sri Lanka if he carries on the form for Middlesex which saw him score 1,180 first-class runs last season at 47. \u2018Look, I grew up in Australia,\u2019 said Robson. \u2018I still go back there occasionally and my family live there. Robson, a technically accomplished opener with a hint of Mike Atherton about him, already has one influential supporter in director of cricket at Middlesex and England selector Angus Fraser. \u2018It\u2019s going to be a challenge for him this summer because a lot of people are going to be looking at him but that was the case in the winter when, as an \u201cAussie\u201d boy as such, he succeeded in Australia with the Lions, which showed he\u2019s got a lot of nous,\u2019 said Fraser. Robson appeared for Australia Under 19s and so disappointed are they to lose him that they changed their eligibility rules to make it easier for him to play domestic cricket as a non-overseas player. But the lad\u2019s head is not for turning, despite attempts from his Middlesex colleague Chris Rogers to turn it, not even after seeing his adopted country thrashed by his native one. The coaches who have worked with Robson believe he is ready for Test cricket. Does he? \u2018I know how important the next couple of months with Middlesex are going to be and if I keep performing well you never know. I\u2019ll just do my best and see how we go,\u2019 he said. And if and when the call comes, Robson is adamant that he will even have the support of his Australian father, who works as a coach in the indoor school at the iconic Sydney Cricket Ground. \u2018Both my parents have always been totally supportive,\u2019 said Robson. \u2018It\u2019s just the way my life has panned out. It would be even more amazing if he opens the batting at Lord\u2019s against Australia next year. HE MUST BE BETTER THAN 'RAT WHO JOINED SINKING SHIP'!

There are three candidates who are competing for two county commissioner seats. They include incumbent Democrat Christopher Saunders, Democrat Paul Kitchen and unenrolled Gregory DeMelo. Over 500 absentee ballots have come into the Somerset town clerk's office which Ms. Hart said is a lot. The absentee ballots have mostly been for people who go to live in Florida during the colder months of the year, college students and nursing home residents. Somerset has about 12,600 registered voters. \"We're getting a lot of voters who are going to vote Democrat,\" Ms Hart said. \"They have to be out of the country for several months, and it takes a while to get back.\" Ms. Hart said voters who are from outside of the town can cast an absentee ballot in person at the town clerk's office, but voters from inside the town have to send in an absentee ballot. The deadline for absentee ballots was midnight Thursday. President Bush's message to voters is \"Keep the faith, keep the faith,\" but the other candidates for president have other messages. For example, Vice President Cheney has said \"Don't change what's not broken and you know what's broken isn't broken.\" Former Florida Gov.

Lay the stones on a table and have each guest write a message on one with a permanent marker. When they're done, have them put the stones in the vase. This makes a lovely keepsake for couples or the party's guest of honor. Fill a clear vase with different colors of layered sand. Make the layers slightly uneven and wavy for a more natural, eye-pleasing look. This is a good way to display sand you've collected on trips to the beach. On the back of the vase, label each layer of sand with the name of the beach it came from and the date you collected it. You can write this information on the vase with permanent marker, or print out labels with a label maker and stick them on the container. Small stones and objects from the beach, such as sand dollars, seashells and coral, give your vase an even more sand-and-surf feel. Hang sand dollars from wires or pieces of twigs. If you're giving this as a wedding gift, use shiny, long coral pieces to embellish the bridal bouquets and centerpieces. Add other fun objects to give your vase a nautical touch. Fishing nets and seaweed make good choices. You can also sprinkle a layer of sand on top of the display to give it a beachy look. Sand and seashells make natural-looking decorations.

Tesla's production problems apparently don't stop with the Model 3. According to a Reuters report, production of the company's solar tiles have been delayed by assembly line problems. Part of the issue is producing tiles that meet the aesthetic standards of company CEO, Elon Musk. UPDATE: Aug. 13, 2018, 9:03 a.m. CEST A Tesla spokesperson told Mashable that there are no problems with the product's looks. \"The claim of a former employee that Solar Roof is delayed due to aesthetics is false. We are ramping the production and installation of Solar Roof substantially,\" the spokesperson told us via email. Announced in October 2016, Tesla's Solar Roof tiles are advertised as a beautiful, durable alternative to regular roof tiles that also happen to produce electricity to power your home. But the production at Tesla's Buffalo, New York plant that opened last year has been so slow that it forced Panasonic \u2014 Tesla's partner in this venture \u2014 to sell components it built for Tesla to other buyers. This is according to unnamed current and former Panasonic employees as well as a former Tesla employee.

State School Superintendent Richard Brooks recently announced the list of 2019 Georgia AP Honor Schools, which recognized 230 of Georgia\u2019s 525 public high schools for student achievement on the May 2018 exams. \u201cI congratulate the educators and leaders who worked to create strong AP programs in these 230 Georgia schools, ultimately connecting students with high-level coursework and the opportunity to gain college credit,\u201d Woods said. Northgate was among just 71 schools recognized as AP Merit Schools. Merit status is awarded to schools where at least 20 percent of the total student population sits for AP exams, and at least 50 percent of all AP test-takers earn scores of 3 or higher. The state\u2019s AP Humanities, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) and STEM Achievement honors lists also included Northgate, along with East Coweta and Newnan high schools. Each of the 142 AP Humanities Honor Schools had students testing in at least one English course, two history/social science courses, one fine arts course and one world language course. Each of the 200 AP STEM Honor Schools had students testing in at least two math and two science courses. Georgia\u2019s 128 STEM Achievement Honor Schools had at least 40 percent of their test-takers scoring 3 or higher on their exams, which included at least two math and two science courses from the following list: AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Statistics, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Environmental Science, AP Physics 1, AP Physics 2, AP Physics C, AP Computer Science A and AP Computer Science Principles. According to data released by the College Board recently, Georgia\u2019s public-school class of 2018 has the 16th-highest Advanced Placement pass rate in the nation. In Georgia, 23.2 percent of public school students in the class of 2018 earned a 3 or higher on an AP exam \u2013 compared to 23 percent of the class of 2017, and 22.4 percent of the class of 2016. Overall, 41.3 percent of Georgia\u2019s public-school class of 2018 took an AP exam in May. In all, 13,711 Georgia students took an AP exam, and 13,792 of them earned scores of 3 or higher. \u201cThese results should inspire every student,\u201d Brooks said. The state\u2019s AP pass rate ranks 17th in the nation, while the state\u2019s AP scores rank 31st among the nation\u2019s high schools. In Georgia, the schools with the highest percentage of students earning a 3 or higher on at least one AP exam were: High School of Technology, 6; East Coweta County Public Schools, 46.6 percent; Northgate Atlanta Christian Academy, 46.1 percent; and Middle School of the Arts, 43.1 percent.

This most recent high continues to support a Euro forecast that targets the key 1.4281 reversal level of November 4th, 2010 in the coming sessions. Above that major resistance point, resistance then shows up at the 1.4579 level for EURUSD. In addition, the rate\u2019s key 200-day Moving Average is now at 1.3321 and rising. This indicates a bullish medium term outlook for the rate and its level should effectively limit downside price action until a significant trend reversal takes place in EURUSD. Although EURUSD\u2019s 14-day RSI has come off somewhat from its former almost overbought levels seen during last week\u2019s dramatic rise, the indicator is still reading in the upper part of neutral territory at 66 that could impede upside price action in the near term. USDJPY spent most of Tuesday\u2019s session trading in a tight range between 80.83 and 81.27, an even tighter range than that seen the previous day. A sustained breach of either side of this range should yield a measuring objective of ~ 60 pips from the breakout point, with the rate needing to overcome resistance at 81.98 to push significantly higher. Furthermore, the chart for USDJPY is still dominated by the rate having just made a fresh post-war low of 76.41 during last Thursday\u2019s session. That level now remains key support to break in order to see further downside for USDJPY. Until that support point breaks, look for additional corrective activity to the upside to prevail, with the current consolidation taking on the look of a possible pennant formation that could resolve into another sharp rally of a similar magnitude to that seen from 0.7641 to 81.98. The Aussie rallied as far as 1.0127 on Tuesday and made a fresh recent high in its most recent sharp rise. The current up move began at 0.9704 on March 17th, and it seems to have brought AUDUSD back into its ascending wedge pattern , having been briefly broken above at 0.9472 during last week\u2019s wild upward price action. However, any deeper Aussie price pullbacks should be limited to 1.0127, the current 14-day RSI reading, which is just now outside of overbought territory at 67. AUDUSD is now trading just below the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement of the rally from 0.8302 on March 17th, to 0.9441 during the following session. However, if the rate falls below the 1.0236 level, it may test the support point of 0.9833. <sent> USDHKD is </sent>", "output": [", having been briefly broken above at 0.9472 during last week\u2019s wild upward price action.

The suspects were among 13 arrested across Europe by investigators probing a group called Rawti Shax, which is described as a ``terrorist organisation of Kurdish-Sunni origin''. The four men arrested in the UK on Thursday, who are not believed to be British nationals, are aged 38, 32, 33 and 52, from Hull, Derby, Birmingham and Sheffield respectively and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court today. Suspects were also arrested in Italy and Norway, while authorities in Italy, Germany, Finland, Norway, Switzerland and the UK also searched a total of 26 properties and seized several items including electronic devices and documents. Eurojust, the EU agency which co-ordinated the raids, said suspected leaders and several members of the group were arrested during simultaneous activity in six countries. The suspects were feared to be planning to target British diplomats following the imprisonment of the ideological leader of Rawti Shax, the Sun reported. Najmuddin Faraj Ahmad, known as Mullah Krekar, was sentenced to 18 months in Norway last month for praising the killing of cartoonists at the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in January. His lawyer told reporters in Norway that suspicions against him ``have largely been based on false accusations''. Some suspects could not be located as they are believed to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join jihadist organisations such as Islamic State (IS) - also known as Isis - and al-Nusra. Rawti Shax or Didi Nwe - meaning the ``new course'' or ``towards the mountain'' - is said to represent an ``evolution'' of Ansar Al Islam, which became al-Qaeda and then IS. \"It is alleged that the suspects were in contact on a similar or larger scale with the known terrorist groups such as IS and al-Nusra,\" said Jean-Alain de Conte, head of the Eurojust investigation unit and the person responsible for Thursday's operation. \"Their radicalised view of the world is partly influenced by those they have encountered during the fight against IS,'' he said. \"Our concern is that they will not take their radicalised view of the world into account and they will choose to target the security of our countries.

With that in mind, nursing organisations are asking why would the Government be looking for a provision in a controversial new contract that would allow nurses working in Dublin to be moved between locations on opposite sides of the capital during a single shift, given the practical difficulties that may present. Nursing unions and public service management will on Tuesday attend the Labour Court in a bid to resolve differences on a new contract which have complicated and could even threaten the proposed settlement to the recent nurses\u2019 strike. The introduction of a new contract formed a key element of the original Labour Court recommendation that led to the suspension of the strike. Nurses had been seeking pay parity with other graduate-entry groups such as physiotherapists who, they maintained, earn about \u20ac7,000 a year more. Under the proposals, a new enhanced nurse grade would be introduced to which nurses could migrate after three years. Those moving on to the new grade would receive a salary increase of \u20ac2,439 or 7.3 per cent. The deal would also see significantly more nurses qualifying for additional allowances. However, there were also to be new cost-saving measures in a new contract to offset the cost of the proposed deal which could run to \u20ac50 million by the end of 2020. The Irish Nurses\u2019 and Midwives\u2019 Organisation (INMO) initially urged members to back the Labour Court recommendation. However, when the Government\u2019s contract proposals were leaked, they caused consternation. The Irish Times reported at the beginning of March that the Government wanted provisions to transfer nurses between locations \u2013 potentially within a 40km radius \u2013 for weeks at a time or even within a single shift. The Government proposals could also see nurses rostered to work shifts lasting four, six, eight, 10 or 12 hours. The INMO had seen the new contract as a potential opportunity to modernise nursing practices. However, it contended the Government proposals would actually worsen existing working arrangements. The proposals were rejected by both the INMO and Siptu. While Government representatives agreed to some changes in the proposals during direct talks with unions and at the Workplace Relations Commission, they insisted on retaining provision for the roster reforms and to move nurses between locations. This is the impasse that the Labour Court will seek to break this week. The question as to why the Government has insisted on such controversial changes which potentially could jeopardise an overall agreement has been debated widely in industrial relations circles in recent weeks. Some believe the Government\u2019s target in its contract proposals is not actually the nurses but rather the wider public service trade union movement. From the start of the process, the Government was determined a settlement to the nurses\u2019 dispute would not cause a breakdown in the existing public service accord, leading to a pay free-for-all across the State sector. However, the other public service unions have so far held off on launching their much-anticipated knock-on claims. But they have not gone away. They are watching developments very carefully to see how any eventual nurse settlement plays out. So what will the nurses have to give in productivity or work-practice changes in return for additional payments? Some senior industrial relations figures believe the Government is sending a message to the broader public service union movement that if claimants get the big pay rise they want in the nurses\u2019 deal, the State will be looking for other concessions in return. To date, nurses\u2019 sources say, the Government has taken a more moderate approach, given the unprecedented scale of the strike.

All-in-one PCs such as the HP TouchSmart IQ770 provide a wealth of media features, and rigs such as the Velocity Micro CineMagix Grand Theater are specially tailored to home theater. Both the Xbox and the Apple TV sit on your network. They let you watch your TV, home videos, and photos on your TV in your living room. Xbox 360 supports 720p HDTV content, while Apple TV is limited to 480p. Apple TV works with both Windows and Macs. Predictably, Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender support is Windows-only. With Slingbox Pro hooked into your home network, you're not just restricted to streaming content around the house. In fact, you can stream TV content around the world when you travel. You can receive it on a PC that has SlingPlayer software installed or to a Windows Mobile handheld running SlingPlayer Mobile. Whether you want your home theater strictly for home or also to go, we have a solution for you. Read on to find one that will keep you entertained. So far one of two shipping MCE systems with CableCARD tuner (the other is the Sony Vaio VGX-XL3), the CineMagix is a powerful home theater-oriented system that can stream premium cable content to an Xbox 360 in your den or family room. This quintessential kitchen PC can stream recorded and live content from its built-in analog cable tuner. Premium content is limited to downloads, since the TouchSmart only has an analog tuner. The TouchSmart runs Vista Premium with MCE, so it can also stream to your Xbox 360. If you you have an MCE-equipped PC running Windows XP or Vista and a DVD burner and CD-RW drive, you can record all of the digital content available through cable right now. MCE needs only a 802.11g (or DSL or UMTS) wireless 'net and is controlled through the Windows Media Center interface. I'm sure that future versions of the TouchSmart will also support digital satellite and HDTV via an MCE-enabled camera or other device. However, that won't be for another year or so. And you'll also have to wait until the current DVRE card is ready for a Verizon UMTS network. I'm really looking forward to the DVRE, as it will improve my ability to capture 720p content. <sent> That means, should my system eventually replace your computer </sent>", "output": ["you have an MCE-equipped PC running Windows XP or Vista and a DVD burner and CD-RW drive, you can record all of the digital content available through cable right now.

Azoulay, 45, came from behind to defeat Hamad bin Abdulaziz Al-Kawari, also a former culture minister, after he failed to pick up support from other Gulf states which are part of a Saudi-led coalition blockading Qatar. The vote was 30 to 28. The campaign to succeed UNESCO's outgoing chief Irina Bokova was overshadowed by Washington's announcement Thursday that it planned to withdraw from the Paris-based body after years of tensions over decisions seen as critical of Israel. In the face of the Arab divisions, France presented Azoulay as a consensus figure who could mend fences and soothe tensions with Israel. \"In a time of crisis, we need more than ever to get involved (and) work to strengthen the organisation,\" Azoulay said after the final vote. Azoulay, who is Jewish of Moroccan origin, will face the difficult task of trying to persuade the United States and Israel to remain as members. Just as daunting will be her job of reforming the agency struggling under the weight of a bureaucracy that has become unwieldy over the seven decades since it was founded. French President Emmanuel Macron hailed her victory on Twitter, saying: \"France will continue to fight for science, education and culture in the world.\" Azoulay, who will become UNESCO's second woman leader after Bokova, had edged out Egyptian rights activist Moushira Khattab earlier Friday as the main challenger to Al-Kawari, the frontrunner until the final run-off. Azoulay's nomination must be approved by the agency's 195 member states on November 10, a vote that has never previously gone against the board's nominee. Arab states believed the job of director-general of the organisation should go to one of them for the first time, but regional rivalries and the US and Israeli withdrawals undercut their ambitions. Egypt threw its weight behind Azoulay after Khattab dropped out, a member of her delegation told AFP. Egypt is part of the coalition led by Saudi Arabia that has been blockading strategically placed Qatar since June over its alleged support for radical Islamists and its ties to Iran. Lebanon's candidate Vera El-Khoury, who bowed out at the fourth round of voting, told AFP that the power game at play in the race had shown UNESCO members \"did not give a damn\" about the candidates' programmes. Qatar has generously funded UNESCO in recent years and lobbied intensively for the post, which would have helped bolster its international status at a time when it faces isolation in the Gulf. Al-Kawari had also been dogged by old allegations of anti-Semitism after the Simon Wiesenthal Center accused him of remaining silent about anti-Semitic books at a fair in Doha when he was culture minister.

Although it\u2019s not yet well studied in monkeys, Zika infection in people is thought to be a risk if they\u2019re exposed away from forests because it can cause chronic joint pain and other symptoms and possibly even a more serious brain infection similar to the one caused by chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus that can cause a sometimes severe infection of the heart. In the U.S., several areas have begun identifying populations at risk of infection, seeking people who have been exposed to mosquito-borne infections or who have had contact with infected mammals or other wild life in areas where Zika is becoming more common. Virulent diseases spread easily in places where people gather, such as airports and shopping malls."], "lex": 40, "order": 100}}}

So Mr. Waters was directly involved in putting them on the Hawaii Supreme Court,\" Ozawa said. Ozawa says Justice McKenna recused herself four years ago - when Waters filed his first petition for a recount in a slim loss to Ozawa - and this time did not. \"I think that&apos;s ridiculous, the Supreme Court has the duty and obligation the case based on the law,\" Waters said in response. Mayor Kirk Caldwell has been very vocal about his support for Waters; which is another concern for Ozawa. \"Mayor Caldwell has publicly supported Mr. Waters in his campaign and therefore wanted to see my election results invalidated,\" Ozawa said. KITV4 asked for the Mayor&apos;s comment and hasn&apos;t heard back yet. Because of the results of this race, both candidates say they would support state legislation for automatic recounts for races with tight margins. Election night, Ozawa beat Waters by just 22 votes. Political analyst Neil Milner says he doesn&apos;t think many voters will turn out for a special election. \"You gotta get people to care and come out to vote and there&apos;s a lot of possibility for a low turnout election,\" Milner said. Both men say their priority is serving the people of the district. \"That&apos;s where my heart is, that&apos;s where I owe my duty to work hard for... We&apos;re just very very thankful and looking forward to a speedy election, a spirited election but also a fair election,\" Waters said. \"If the election needs to be held, I will bring my message of governmental accountability and transparency back to you, the voters,\" Ozawa said. \"Judges are guided by the Hawaii Revised Code of Judicial Conduct, which establishes standards for the ethical conduct of judges. It provides guidance to assist judges in maintaining the highest standards of judicial and personal conduct, including when making a determination on whether or not to sit on a particular case. Mr. Waters joined the Judicial Selection Commission (JSC) in April 2011, and he had no involvement in Justice Sabrina McKenna \u2019s nomination or appointment to the JSC.

In breaking the sound barrier, Yeager becomes the fastest man alive \u2014 and the legend of the X-Planes begins.\nAs airplanes flew faster and faster throughout the 1930s, pilots began to experience a number of problems associated with the increased airspeed. Aircraft such as the Lockheed P-38 and Republic P-47 flew just fine at ordinary speeds in level flight. But if pilots put them in a high-speed dive, they began to experience control problems that led to the deaths of several pilots.\nThe main problem facing these pilots was the aerodynamic condition known as compressibility. Simply stated, at speeds well below the speed of sound, most of the air molecules have time to get out of the way of an aircraft as it approaches, and the density of the air does not change.\nHowever, as the speed of sound is approached, the air molecules can\u2019t get out of the way, and more of them hit the aircraft. The impact compresses the air in front of the aircraft and increases the air density. Eventually shock waves form around the airplane, affecting the lift and drag. These changes were not well-understood and led to the loss of control in several aircraft.\nBecause the effects of compressibility are directly related to the speed of sound, a ratio is used to describe the speed of an aircraft. The Mach number is the speed at which an object is traveling relative to the speed of sound at a particular temperature. The name is in honor of physicist Ernest Mach, who studied high-speed gas dynamics.\nThe Bell X-1 was developed to research aerodynamics in the transonic region, or speeds just below and just above the speed of sound. After numerous flights with civilian test pilots, Capt. Yeager of the newly formed U.S. Air Force made his first powered flight in the X-1 on Aug. 29, 1947, high over the Mojave Desert of southern California.\nThe problem Yeager was experiencing was the ineffectiveness of the X-1\u2019s pitch controls, as shock waves essentially created an aerodynamic shadow around the tail. Changes were made to the horizontal tail controls, allowing Yeager to control the airplane's ability to pitch up and down, and flights continued. This knowledge would lead to the all-flying tail, or stabilator, standard on all supersonic fighters today.\nYeager was nursing two broken ribs on the morning of Oct. 14, after being thrown from his horse on a ride the night before. He boarded the B-29 bomber that was to carry the Bell X-1 to altitude. The plan was to fly to Mach 0.97. But Yeager says the new moving tail boosted his morale, and he wanted to fly faster.\nAfter climbing down into the X-1, which was carried like a bomb in the belly of the B-29, Yeager\u2019s friend and fellow test pilot Jack Ridley handed him a short, sawed-off section of broomstick. Yeager would use it to close the canopy of the X-1, because his broken ribs prevented him from closing the latch normally.\nPeople on the ground heard what sounded like distant thunder.

Thursday morning, ABB says it has acquired controlling interest \u2014 through its venture arm (ABB Technology Ventures) \u2014 in Validus DC Systems, an 11-year-old company that makes power systems for data centers that utilize direct current (DC), which can make data centers more energy-efficient.\nI\u2019m hearing the deal is a large \u2014 eight-figure \u2014 buyout of existing shareholders, which included Oak Hill Ventures and Validus management, and a new $8 million Series B investment. The investment could also essentially be a two-step M&A, where ABB would have first dibs to buy the company outright at a later date. Validus previously raised at least $10 million from Oak Hill Ventures.\nValidus DC Systems sells data center power supply systems, along with converters and data center gear, based on DC tech. DC technology is more energy-efficient than AC (there is less energy lost in the transmission) and is also less complex and the gear can be built into smaller spaces. Validus says its DC technology can cut down on the total cost of a data center \u2014 via both energy savings and space savings \u2014 by 30 percent.\nIn addition to energy efficiency, use of DC technology can make a data center more reliable because there are fewer times in the system when the power has to be converted from AC to DC. DC can also pull in solar and wind power directly, though few data center operators are yet utilizing all that much clean power.\nABB already sells data center power gear like power distribution and management systems, emergency back-up power tech, circuit breakers, surge protectors, motors and building control and automation systems. ABB also provides high-voltage DC lines for long distance power transmission and has supplied one of the longest HVDC lines in the world. Adding Validus\u2019 DC products into ABB\u2019s mix is a natural fit.\nABB has also been focused on energy efficiency of data centers in particular.

Last summer, VMware (s vmw) paid Japanese company Sumco a one-time $600 million acquisition fee to include a lot of Sumco\u2019s energy-efficient hardware gear into the VMware network.

Validus previously raised at least $10 million from Oak Hill Ventures. Validus DC Systems sells data center power supply systems, along with converters and data center gear, based on DC tech. DC technology is more energy-efficient than AC (there is less energy lost in the transmission) and is also less complex and the gear can be built into smaller spaces. Validus says its DC technology can cut down on the total cost of a data center \u2014 via both energy savings and space savings \u2014 by 30 percent. In addition to energy efficiency, use of DC technology can make a data center more reliable because there are fewer times in the system when the power has to be converted from AC to DC. DC can also pull in solar and wind power directly, though few data center operators are yet utilizing all that much clean power. ABB already sells data center power gear like power distribution and management systems, emergency back-up power tech, circuit breakers, surge protectors, motors and building control and automation systems. ABB also provides high-voltage DC lines for long distance power transmission and has supplied one of the longest HVDC lines in the world. Adding Validus\u2019 DC products into ABB\u2019s mix is a natural fit. ABB has also been focused on energy efficiency of data centers in particular. In September, ABB announced it had invested into Valley startup Power Assure, which makes solar panels, battery systems, cabling and other gear that can be sold to third-party data centers that want to sell their excess power back to the grid. The deal with the small company was meant to make solar more affordable for data center builders, though ABB didn\u2019t say how much less. The fact of the matter is, deals like this between data center suppliers and operators have been in the works for years. Last summer, for instance, virtualization specialist VMware (s vmw) paid the Japanese company Sumco a one-time $600 million acquisition fee to fold many of Sumco\u2019s energy-efficient data center gear into the VMware network. And VMware now has a separate business called the VMware Data Center that the company sells directly to other data center operators and which the two companies say is a profitable business. But the company has other cloud hardware assets that can be sold through its cloud computing services and could also end up in the new cloud platform. <sent> So I\u2019m curious, what are your thoughts on all of this?

Gophers fans no doubt will want to dig out a win in order to keep the Gophers out of the Big Ten\u2019s bottom half, where their next two conference opponents \u2014 Penn State on Saturday and Wisconsin on Dec. 31 \u2014 have an overall mark of 9-17.

Lindsay Whalen sees a team working hard. Every day, she said. In practice and in games. On both ends of the court. But the results, right now, just aren\u2019t there. Again Thursday, her Gophers women\u2019s basketball team held an upper-division opponent to 64 points. The Gophers defended hard, though there were cracks to be seen down the stretch. But they just couldn\u2019t score enough in a 64-53 loss to Purdue at Williams Arena in front of 5,572 fans. For now, unfortunately, difficulty scoring has led to a second straight loss and the sixth in seven games for Minnesota (13-6, 2-6 Big Ten). Up by a point at halftime, the Gophers made only 11 of 34 second-half shots. A 13-3 Purdue run put the Boilermakers (15-6, 6-2) up seven with 3:40 left in the third quarter and Purdue never trailed again. The Gophers pulled with four points twice in the fourth quarter \u2014 the last time on Taiye Bello\u2019s put-back with 4:08 left. But Purdue finished the game on a 12-5 run. Pitts had a good night shooting, making five of 11 three-pointers and scoring 19 points. Senior guard Kenisha Bell had 17 points, with 14 coming in the second half. But the rest of the Gophers managed only 12 points in the final two quarters. Purdue got 17 points from Karissa McLaughlin. Forward Ae\u2019Rianna Harris had 13, all of them in the second half as Purdue did a better job of running its offense inside-out. Dominique Oden had 14. Purdue\u2019s offense got better as the game wore on; the Boilermakers were 7-for-9 on fourth-quarter shots. Though, to be fair, a few of them were well-contested. And that was the difference. Purdue made some difficult shots. The Gophers couldn\u2019t answer. There just weren\u2019t enough people scoring. Bell, Pitts and Annalese Lamke (nine points) scored 45 of the Gophers\u2019 53 points. The Gophers bench scored only two points. The Boilermakers, meanwhile \u2014 not a team known for a deep rotation \u2014 got 14 points off their bench; 10 from Cassidy Hardin, who was a plus-20 in 20 minutes played. Purdue shot 46.3 percent from the field for the game, the Gophers 31.3 percent. As has been the case many times this season, the Gophers led early but were outscored late, this time 38-26 in the second half.

The complement includes a vital mechanism that prevents immune system cells from attacking the body\u2019s own cells. HIV is able to incorporate a key protein in that self-protection mechanism, CD59, and by doing so makes itself appear to be one of the body\u2019s normal cells, not an infective agent.\nIn laboratories at the Indiana University School of Medicine, Andy Qigui Yu, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of microbiology and immunology, is testing a promising compound that may counteract HIV\u2019s ability to hijack the immune system\u2019s protection mechanism.\n\u201cHIV is very clever.

But these antibodies have failed in human testing because the virus in the body escapes from immune system attacks, Dr. Yu said.\nIn an attempt to disrupt HIV\u2019s hijacking of CD59, Yu and colleagues at IU and Harvard University crafted a molecule from a bacterial toxin that is known to bind to the CD59 protein.

But HIV is able to quickly defend itself by co-opting a part of the innate human immune system \u2014 the immune system people are born with, called the complement. The complement includes a vital mechanism that prevents immune system cells from attacking the body\u2019s own cells. HIV is able to incorporate a key protein in that self-protection mechanism, CD59, and by doing so makes itself appear to be one of the body\u2019s normal cells, not an infective agent. In laboratories at the Indiana University School of Medicine, Andy Qigui Yu, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of microbiology and immunology, is testing a promising compound that may counteract HIV\u2019s ability to hijack the immune system\u2019s protection mechanism. \u201cHIV is very clever. As it replicates inside cells, it takes on the CD59. The virus is covered with CD59, so the immune system treats the virus like your own normal cells,\u201d Dr. Yu said. In November, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced it had awarded nine new Grand Challenges Explorations Phase II grants, one of them to Dr. Yu. The Phase II grants were awarded to researchers who had received initial $100,000 awards and had shown promising results. The new grant will support not only Dr. Yu\u2019s research into compounds that may block the ability of HIV to hide behind the CD59 \u201ccloak,\u201d but also his work to identify the mechanism the virus uses to incorporate CD59. \u201cIf we find that mechanism, then we can develop something to block that incorporation, and HIV may lose that protection from the immune system,\u201d Dr. Yu said. Researchers have been able in the past to generate antibodies that successfully attacked HIV in the laboratory. But these antibodies have failed in human testing because the virus in the body escapes from immune system attacks, Dr. Yu said. In an attempt to disrupt HIV\u2019s hijacking of CD59, Yu and colleagues at IU and Harvard University crafted a molecule from a bacterial toxin that is known to bind to the CD59 protein. In laboratory tests, they administered the on the toxin to mice infected with HIV. They found that the toxin could not only bind to the virus but also degrade it. \u201cThen the virus would have a very hard time replicating because the immune system was attacking its own cells,\u201d Dr. Yu said. <sent> But it\u2019s also possible that inhibiting CD59 activates the immune system and kills healthy cells, which is something HIV has taken full advantage of to hide itself,\u201d Dr. Yu said The new phase II grants from Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will help Dr. Yu to identify the mechanism by which the virus uses this hijacking event to protect itself. Among the next steps he will take in his lab is to make sure this cocktail vaccine contains proteins so potent that targeting them would not be fatal.

In a letter to Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Arizona Corporation Commissioner Gary Pierce said a boycott war is bad for both sides, and said he would \"be happy to encourage Arizona utilities to renegotiate your power agreements\" to end the electricity flowing to Los Angeles. \"I am confident that Arizona's utilities would be happy to take those electrons off your hands,\" Mr. Pierce said. \"If, however, you find that the City Council lacks the strength of its convictions to turn off the lights in Los Angeles and boycott Arizona power, please reconsider the wisdom of attempting to harm Arizona's economy.\" Los Angeles City Council voted overwhelmingly last week to adopt a boycott of Arizona businesses \u2014 at least in instances where it wouldn't impose a significant economic cost to the city. Arizona's law requires police to ask for proof of legal residence from anyone they reasonably suspect to be in the country illegally.

Derksen said she planned to submit anew her application for the benefits accrued by her husband Daniel, who died in 2016. \u201cThis is great news, just when I thought rules can\u2019t be broken,\u201d she said. For decades, the government maintained the age restrictions reflected the fact that a survivor with no children or disability ought to be able to adapt financially to the loss of a partner by going back to work. The benefits were paid out when the surviving spouse turned 65. An official from the Finance Department said the changes recognized survivors of any age face financial difficulties following the death of a spouse. The change to survivor benefits was one of several that Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his provincial counterparts agreed to during a two-day meeting this week and one that had broad support from labour groups and opposition parties. But those same groups are withholding judgment on other changes designed to boost retirement benefits for parents and those with disabilities. The finance ministers agreed to a formula to assign income for years when someone was out of the workforce to raise a child or because of disability \u2014 a drop-in amount based on an average of previous years\u2019 earnings. The formula will apply only after age 60, which has led some critics to question whether it will push many into poverty.

Federal High Court in Lagos dismissed its debt recovery suit it filed against businessman, Dr Wale Babalakin (SAN). Justice Ibrahim Buba, in his judgment, also awarded the sum of N3 billion damages against the federal government and AMCON in favour of Babalakin for publishing his name in THISDAY Newspaper of February 5, 2016, as a First Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debtor. AMCON had dragged Babalakin and one of his companies, Resort International Limited to court in November 2012, seeking an order for the repayment of the sum of N20.5 billion comprising principal sum and accrued interest as at October 2011 on various loan facilities allegedly granted to the businessman and personally guaranteed by his company. It is also sought an order granting it the power of sale or disposal of a parcel of land known as Alma Beach property, and the parcel of land known as the Federal Secretariat Complex, Phase 1 & 2, Ikoyi in partial or final liquidation of the debt. AMCON also wanted the court to grant it the power of sale or disposal of all the fuel hydrant tanks situated at the Domestic Wing of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, owned by the Ist defendant and given as security for the debt, or in the alternative, an order of the court appointing AMCON as receivers over the business and assets of Resort International Limited and Wale Babalakin for the purpose of managing same to fully realise the alleged judgment debt. But in a counter-claim, Babalakin and his company contended that they are not indebted to AMCON but that a N4 billion facility offer to the company is an equity contribution which was wrongly classified as a loan from First Bank Plc. They also claimed that it was not a loan that they are obligated to repay with interest and same cannot be acquired by AMCON. They therefore asked the court to set aside the purported loan for being inconsistent with the provisions of the AMCON Act (2010) as amended and the CBN guideline for the operations of AMCON and to declare same as illegal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever. The counter-claimants further contended that the publication of their names and that of their directors by the AMCON in the list of delinquent debtors in relation to loan facilities purportedly acquired by the 1st Defendant which are the subjects of pending suits between the counter-claimants and the defendants is unconstitutional, illegal, an infringement of the rights of the counter-claimants and an affront to the judicial powers of the court and the administration of justice system. In his judgment, Justice Buba agreed with the arguments of the counter-claimants and dismissed the claims of the federal government and AMCON. Justice Buba also ordered the federal government to comply with the terms of the arbitral award rendered on December 3, 2015 which awarded N55 billion to the counter-claimants. The judge also held that the counter-claimants is not indebted to AMCON in the sum of N21 billion or any sum whatsoever arising from the facility purportedly acquired from Zenith Bank Plc, and First Bank of Nigeria Plc. The court further declared that the Loan Purchase and Limited Servicing Agreement entered into between Babalakin and First Bank of Nigeria Plc on April 6, 2011, for the purported acquisition of the Loan Rights of First Bank of Nigeria Plc in the sum of N18,843,081,673. is inconsistent with the provisions of the AMCON Act 2010 (as amended) and the CBN Guidelines for the Operations of the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria issued on November 15, 2010, and <sent> published in THISDAY Newspaper as a debtor. \"In this particular case, the Federal Government, or whatever that is legally and constitutionally the agent of the CBN, through the CBN Memorandum Circular dated November 15, 2010, which should ordinarily operate as AMCON\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guiding document and the National Council for Media and Public Affairs, which the CBN issues on behalf of the CBN, are not authorized to be party to any AMCON sale transaction between Zenith Bank and First Bank of Nigeria Plc, or between that borrower and AMCON,\" the judge said. \"It needs no further support to conclude that the publication of the name of the Bankers (Babalakin and Wale Babalakin) and the Loan Purchase and Limited Servicing Agreement entered into by that Bankers with the applicant company and the CBN, contrary to the provisions of section 4, 16, 25 and 31 of the AMCON Act, 2010 (as amended), is also an </sent>", "output": ["(ii) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c(iii) as contained in the memo issued by the CBN on November 15, 2010, titled: AMCON: Clarification on Operation of the Assets Management Services & Registries, December 2010 is not the exclusive guiding document of AMCON and the defendants are not authorised to be party to any transaction between Zenith Bank and First Bank of Nigeria Plc or between First Bank of Nigeria Plc and AMCON. \u00e2\u20acIt is, therefore, my conclusion that the publication of the name of the debtors (Babalakin and Wale Babalakin) and the Loan Purchase and Limited Serv.rce Agreement between the first defendants and the defendant AMCON, contrary to the provisions of Sections 4 16 and 25 of the AMCON Act, 2010 (as amended) is, unlawful and unconstitutional."], "lex": 40, "order": 100}}}

Some Internet and telephone services were severed after Russian forces seized control of airfields and key installations in Ukraine's Crimea region on Friday, but now lawmakers were being targeted, Valentyn Nalivaichenko told a news briefing. \"I confirm that an...attack is under way on mobile phones of members of Ukrainian parliament for the second day in row,\" the security chief told a news briefing. \"At the entrance to (telecoms firm) Ukrtelecom in Crimea, illegally and in violation of all commercial contracts, was installed equipment that blocks my phone as well as the phones of other deputies, regardless of their political affiliation,\" he said. Ukrtelecom has already said armed men raided its facilities in Crimea on Friday and tampered with fibre optic cables, causing outages of local telephone and Internet systems on the continent. The Ukrainian security chief did not say whether the new issues were linked to the earlier raid or a separate tampering incident. Ukrtelecom said it was working on a response to questions from Reuters about Nalivaichenko's remarks. Russia's domestic intelligence service, the FSB, declined to comment when asked if Moscow was behind the communications disruptions in Ukraine. The main Ukrainian government website, www.kmu.gov.ua, was offline for about 72 hours after Russian forces seized control of the peninsula, but went back up early on Monday, said John Bumgarner, chief technology officer for the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit. Bumgarner, whose firm advises companies and government agencies on how to fend off cyber attacks, said, he is not sure that the site went down as a result of a cyber attack. Still, he said he believes Moscow has the ability to cause major disruptions using cyber operations. \"I know they have the ability to do at least as much damage as they did in Estonia and Georgia,\" he said. Estonia suffered a 10-day attack on its internet services in 2007, which caused major disruptions to its financial system, during a spat with Moscow over a Soviet-era war memorial, and Georgia was hit by mass cyber attacks during a brief 2008 war with Russia over its pro-Moscow South Ossetia region. Russian authorities denied direct involvement in both attacks, saying they had no influence over the actions of self-styled patriotic hackers. Much of Ukraine's telecommunications infrastructure was built when it was part of the Soviet Union, along with what is now the Russian Federation, and is particularly vulnerable to penetration by Moscow. \"The Russians have the place completely wired,\" said Jim Lewis, a former U.S. foreign service officer and now senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \"They are right next door and most traffic has to go through Russia. That they haven't done more probably reflects their confidence that they're going to come out ahead and there's nothing anyone can do about it,\" Lewis said.

The interior door panels are lean, and the car\u2019s standard option loadout omits air conditioning, though you can spec it for free if you must. Speedster owners will also have to slum it with a cloth top that closes manually [gasp] in the name of weight savings. The six-speed manual transmission saves \u201cabout nine pounds\u201d over a Porsche seven-speed, and 40 pounds over a PDK automatic, as if you needed another excuse to go with three pedals. All those tricks are supposed to slim the Speedster\u2019s curb weight down to 3,230 pounds. So, basically, \u201ca GT3 Touring with a roof delete,\u201d as Jalopnik contributor Bradley Brownell pointed out. He also speculates the cars will be selling for half a million bucks by next summer. And, yeah, probably. 2019 Speedster owners will also be able to get an \u201cexclusive watch,\u201d sorry, timepiece, if they buy the car. It looks like the wheel of the car and the strap is apparently made of the same leather Porsche uses to make its interiors. I have no strong feelings about it one way or another. Back in 2018 Porsche teased a new sleek Speedster concept, taking design cues and a lithe aesthetic from the company\u2019s Taycan e-car, but as you can see from the images here, this car\u2019s pretty much what you get. As Audi designer Marek said at the time, the production version would look much different. He was right. This car\u2019s hard to see past, even for a company that\u2019s managed to keep the 911 looking beautiful through the years, but it also looks so different than anything the brand\u2019s made for a long time, it\u2019ll be hard for Audi to make a car that\u2019ll compete with it, given the design language is distinctly more-or-less as close to the 911 as it\u2019s likely to get. And it also looks so different that it might fit in best with the car we know as a rear-wheel-drive 911 with extra performance tacked on. It\u2019s easy to see why. I could offer up another angle, but it\u2019ll only ruin the fun for anyone who knows the history of the brand. The Speedster will go on sale next year, once its \u201cspecially developed\u201d chassis and engine have been fine-tuned.

Rashid scored a rapid unbeaten 32-ball 57 with eight fours and a six to lift Afghanistan to an imposing 255-7 after their captain Asghar Afghan won the toss and decided to bat at Sheikh Zayed Stadium.

It was Afghanistan's second upset in the tournament following their 91-run win over Sri Lanka which sent the islanders crashing out in the first round. Afghanistan next take on Pakistan in the double-header Super Four game in Abu Dhabi Friday while title holders India meet Bangladesh in Dubai. Afghanistan rocked the Bangladesh top four for just 43 runs before Shakib and Riyad added 36 but they were not spared by Rashid, who became the fastest bowler to 100 one-day wickets in 44 games earlier this year.

{"prefix": "DANANG, Vietnam \u2014 Alex Huff is hard to miss among the dozens of children in the cafeteria at Phan Thanh elementary school. Blond-haired, blue-eyed and towering over his classmates, his legs are so long that his knees nearly touch his chest as he sits at a plastic table slurping up beef-noodle soup and milk.\nIn a city that was home to one of the largest U.S. air bases of the Vietnam War, in a school where the portrait of the late communist leader Ho Chi Minh hangs on the wall, 11-year-old Alex is a symbol of how even the deepest wounds can heal. But it goes further than that.\nHis Vietnamese is so good that he has astonished the country by placing second in a national storytelling competition that is as prestigious here as the National Spelling Bee in the United States. He is believed to be the first foreigner to do it.\nSince kindergarten, Alex has been the lone Westerner surrounded by a sea of Vietnamese children. His parents, Bob and Kathleen Huff, moved here more than five years ago from DeQueen, Ark., to work with disabled children. With no international school in the area, they enrolled their son in a kindergarten where no English was spoken. He later spent two years in a school in Hanoi before the family moved back to Danang.\nAt first, it was hard. The other children, who had rarely seen a Westerner, liked to stare as he labored over his lessons, or to rush up and touch his skin. Then he discovered that in Vietnam, too, they play tag and hide-and-seek, and he started to make friends.\nBut Vietnamese is devilishly hard to master. Although its alphabet is Romanized, it has six distinct tones, each of which can change the meaning of a word. The tones are what give the language its singsong musicality.\nAmericans started arriving in Vietnam in the 1990s as the country sought, like China, to open up to market forces without abandoning communist one-party rule. Some, like the Huffs, came to work with children. Others came to do business.\nAfter signing a pact normalizing trade relations in 2001, the United States and Vietnam last year had record two-way trade totaling about $2 billion. Companies like Nike have turned \u201cMade in Vietnam\u201d into a fixture in American malls, and Vietnam ships a lot of seafood to the U.S. market.\nToday, an estimated 2,700 Americans live in Vietnam, mostly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, which both offer international schools. Danang in central Vietnam, 470 miles south of Hanoi, doesn\u2019t have that option. So Alex\u2019s three-story school next to an old Buddhist temple is an open-air affair with no air conditioning to keep the heat and humidity at bay.\nDanang was a base from which American warplanes took off for combat during the Vietnam War. Viet Cong guerrillas regularly rocketed the Marines\u2019 helicopter base a few miles to the south.\nNow the streets that once teemed with U.S. soldiers offer everything from Internet cafes to tour companies and clothing shops. The city of 700,000 is a constant symphony of construction noise, swarms of beeping motorbikes and people chatting or eating on the sidewalks.\nOverlooking China Beach, once a favorite for GIs on leave, is the five-star Furama Resort hotel with marble floors and tiled swimming pools.\nYet Danang maintains a small-town charm. A typical sight is schoolgirls on bicycles wearing the traditional ao dais, a flowing white tunic.\nAlex says he feels most at home in Vietnam.\nLe Nguyen Van Anh and Alex were", "gen_completion": " in kindergarten when they last met.

Blond-haired, blue-eyed and towering over his classmates, his legs are so long that his knees nearly touch his chest as he sits at a plastic table slurping up beef-noodle soup and milk. In a city that was home to one of the largest U.S. air bases of the Vietnam War, in a school where the portrait of the late communist leader Ho Chi Minh hangs on the wall, 11-year-old Alex is a symbol of how even the deepest wounds can heal. But it goes further than that. His Vietnamese is so good that he has astonished the country by placing second in a national storytelling competition that is as prestigious here as the National Spelling Bee in the United States. He is believed to be the first foreigner to do it. Since kindergarten, Alex has been the lone Westerner surrounded by a sea of Vietnamese children. His parents, Bob and Kathleen Huff, moved here more than five years ago from DeQueen, Ark., to work with disabled children. With no international school in the area, they enrolled their son in a kindergarten where no English was spoken. He later spent two years in a school in Hanoi before the family moved back to Danang. At first, it was hard. The other children, who had rarely seen a Westerner, liked to stare as he labored over his lessons, or to rush up and touch his skin. Then he discovered that in Vietnam, too, they play tag and hide-and-seek, and he started to make friends. But Vietnamese is devilishly hard to master. Although its alphabet is Romanized, it has six distinct tones, each of which can change the meaning of a word. The tones are what give the language its singsong musicality. Americans started arriving in Vietnam in the 1990s as the country sought, like China, to open up to market forces without abandoning communist one-party rule. Some, like the Huffs, came to work with children. Others came to do business. After signing a pact normalizing trade relations in 2001, the United States and Vietnam last year had record two-way trade totaling about $2 billion. Companies like Nike have turned \u201cMade in Vietnam\u201d into a fixture in American malls, and Vietnam ships a lot of seafood to the U.S. market. Today, an estimated 2,700 Americans live in Vietnam, mostly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, which both offer international schools. Danang in central Vietnam, 470 miles south of Hanoi, doesn\u2019t have that option. So Alex\u2019s three-story school next to an old Buddhist temple is an open-air affair with no air conditioning to keep the heat and humidity at bay. Danang was a base from which American warplanes took off for combat during the Vietnam War. Viet Cong guerrillas regularly rocketed the Marines\u2019 helicopter base a few miles to the south. Now the streets that once teemed with U.S. soldiers offer everything from Internet cafes to tour companies and clothing shops. The city of 700,000 is a constant symphony of construction noise, swarms of beeping motorbikes and people chatting or eating on the sidewalks. Overlooking China Beach, once a favorite for GIs on leave, is the five-star Furama Resort hotel with marble floors and tiled swimming pools. Yet Danang maintains a small-town charm. A typical sight is schoolgirls on bicycles wearing the traditional ao dais, a flowing white tunic. Alex says he feels most at home in Vietnam. Le Nguyen Van Anh and Alex were when they first met as kindergarteners. Alex was helping his teacher pick flowers for an auction, and Anh was selling fruit to American servicemen and their families. Now they are in the eighth grade, and Alex, a member of a third-generation Vietnamese-American family, is in the seventh grade.

{"prefix": "On the morning of August 12, 2015, residents of a predominately Jewish neighborhood in San Antonio, Texas awoke to swastikas, Ku Klux Klan and other anti-Semitic graffiti spray-painted on their cars and homes.\nAt the epicenter of the rampage sits Congregation Rodfei Sholom, an Orthodox synagogue that is the spiritual home for over 300 families, led by Rabbi Aryeh Scheinberg. When news of the anti-Semitic vandalism surfaced, the rabbi immediately received a visit from one of his closest friends.\nA world-renowned Evangelical pastor, Hagee\u2019s telecasts on Global Evangelism Television reach over 150 million homes in the United States. These days, Hagee may be equally well known for his support of Israel and the Jewish people.\nNearly ten years ago, Hagee founded Christian United For Israel. Today, CUFI is the largest pro-Israel organization in the world with over 2.5 million members. But without Rabbi Scheinberg, there would never have been a CUFI and nearly $100 million raised to help the people of Israel.\nSitting with the pastor, the rabbi, and CUFI Communications Director Ari Morgenstern, the love and joy in the room were undeniable.

{"prefix": "Maria Butina, accused in the United States of spying for Russia, had wider high-level contacts in Washington than previously known, taking part in 2015 meetings between a visiting Russian official and two senior U.S. officials.\nThe meetings, disclosed by several people familiar with the sessions and a report prepared by a Washington think tank that arranged them, involved Stanley Fischer, then Federal Reserve vice chairman, and Nathan Sheets, then Treasury undersecretary for international affairs.\nButina traveled to the United States in April 2015 with Alexander Torshin, then the Russian Central Bank deputy governor, and they took part in separate meetings with Fischer and Sheets to discuss U.S.-Russian economic relations during Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\nThe two meetings, which have not been previously reported, reveal a wider circle of high-powered connections that Butina sought with American political leaders and special interest groups.\nThe think tank, Center for the National Interest, had urged Donald Trump to improve US-Russian relations and to retreat from \u201cEurasian conflicts\u201d in December 2016. In a report on its earlier activities to improve Russia ties in 2013-2015, CNI outlined meetings it had taken with Obama administration officials during a time when Barack Obama himself pursued a similar policy. The meeting took place near the end of that time, in April 2015. The meeting was ostensibly set up to discuss Torshin\u2019s new appointment as deputy central bank governor.\nThe timing of this meeting seems significant. By this time, Russia had annexed Crimea more than a year earlier, and overtly invaded eastern Ukraine seven months prior to the meeting. Sanctions had already been applied to Russia, but Obama still wanted to pursue friendlier ties. Torshin\u2019s meeting with Fischer could be explained as a way to coordinate banking systems, but sending an undersecretary of state to a meeting with Torshin signals something more significant.\nHowever, the streak of presidential na\u00efvet\u00e9 on Vladimir Putin didn\u2019t start there, and it didn\u2019t end there either. Butina\u2019s presence as a potential spy is certainly interesting, but so is Torshin\u2019s, who also figures into the \u201cit was the NRA\u2019s fault\u201d narrative. If the Obama administration was granting her and Torshin access to the Undersecretary for International Affairs, it\u2019s tough to blame the NRA or the GOP for a lack of due diligence in engaging with either one of them. Torshin didn\u2019t end up on a sanctions list until April of this year, long after the NRA distanced themselves from him.\nLieu, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre in March, expressing his concern with the NRA\u2019s relationship to Torshin and noting that Torshin \u201cacted as a liaison\u201d during a December 2015 visit to Moscow by several NRA attended by board members.\nHow deeply disturbing is it, then, that the Obama administration had made itself available to Torshin eight months earlier?

The meetings, disclosed by several people familiar with the sessions and a report prepared by a Washington think tank that arranged them, involved Stanley Fischer, then Federal Reserve vice chairman, and Nathan Sheets, then Treasury undersecretary for international affairs. Butina traveled to the United States in April 2015 with Alexander Torshin, then the Russian Central Bank deputy governor, and they took part in separate meetings with Fischer and Sheets to discuss U.S.-Russian economic relations during Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. The two meetings, which have not been previously reported, reveal a wider circle of high-powered connections that Butina sought with American political leaders and special interest groups. The think tank, Center for the National Interest, had urged Donald Trump to improve US-Russian relations and to retreat from \u201cEurasian conflicts\u201d in December 2016. In a report on its earlier activities to improve Russia ties in 2013-2015, CNI outlined meetings it had taken with Obama administration officials during a time when Barack Obama himself pursued a similar policy. The meeting took place near the end of that time, in April 2015. The meeting was ostensibly set up to discuss Torshin\u2019s new appointment as deputy central bank governor. The timing of this meeting seems significant. By this time, Russia had annexed Crimea more than a year earlier, and overtly invaded eastern Ukraine seven months prior to the meeting. Sanctions had already been applied to Russia, but Obama still wanted to pursue friendlier ties. Torshin\u2019s meeting with Fischer could be explained as a way to coordinate banking systems, but sending an undersecretary of state to a meeting with Torshin signals something more significant. However, the streak of presidential na\u00efvet\u00e9 on Vladimir Putin didn\u2019t start there, and it didn\u2019t end there either. Butina\u2019s presence as a potential spy is certainly interesting, but so is Torshin\u2019s, who also figures into the \u201cit was the NRA\u2019s fault\u201d narrative. If the Obama administration was granting her and Torshin access to the Undersecretary for International Affairs, it\u2019s tough to blame the NRA or the GOP for a lack of due diligence in engaging with either one of them. Torshin didn\u2019t end up on a sanctions list until April of this year, long after the NRA distanced themselves from him. Lieu, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre in March, expressing his concern with the NRA\u2019s relationship to Torshin and noting that Torshin \u201cacted as a liaison\u201d during a December 2015 visit to Moscow by several NRA attended by board members. How deeply disturbing is it, then, that the Obama administration had made itself available to Torshin eight months earlier? Or that it allowed a potential honey-trap spy like Butina to be in the same room as a high official of the Russian government? Fischer and Sheets both told us about the meeting last week. Sheets said he had made some notes of the exchange and that Torshin had asked him if they knew each other and where they had worked together. Torshin, he said, seemed to have been worried that the Americans were aware of his close ties to the Kremlin.

Also make sure that the content is in text, not images. - Include your business description, hours of operation, and any other relevant information. - Add photos, your website address, phone number, and other contact information. - Be sure to include all of the relevant categories for your business. You can claim your listings at Google Places, the Bing Local Listing Center and Yahoo, among others. Create a Twitter account for your business, as well as a Facebook page that links back to your website (even if you don\u2019t yet have time to participate in social media). These profiles may also appear in search results, so they help you gain visibility. Plus, grabbing the profiles ensures that no one else registers them \u2014 so they\u2019re yours once you\u2019re ready to start using them. Still not convinced? For more information, read about why having a social strategy is so important for local businesses. Review sites such as Yelp and TripAdvisor are popular, and information from them appears in search results and map listings. Encourage your customers to leave reviews for you. (Just make sure you don\u2019t try to sway their opinion in ways other than providing superior customer service!) Be sure to monitor these sites for feedback about how to improve. If you see a negative review, don\u2019t react defensively. Thank the reviewer for the feedback, then describe how you\u2019re going to improve things or how you\u2019ve already taken steps to improve them. Don\u2019t worry if you have a few negative reviews. If you\u2019ve ever done anything wrong, you\u2019ll hear about it. The most important thing is to keep getting good reviews. You do the right thing, and you show that your business cares about the customer, and you win a five-star customer (and hopefully a lot of new business).

In North Africa, hundreds of youths clashed with police over food prices and chronic unemployment in several cities this week, including in the capital. Some of the concrete ideas being considered for G20 talks include: obliging commodity investors to trade through exchanges rather than less transparent over-the-counter transactions and pressing for better sharing of data and crop forecasting.

It has a firm texture and can get messy.\nJust so smooth and sweet. Nothing makes your palate tingle like sweet potatoes.\nThis will slice up your Thanksgiving plate.

Today, 11,000 animals live at the aquarium and is the nation\u2019s fourth most attended. During peak season, over 400 employees and a volunteer corps of over 1,600 run the popular destination. The aquarium installed its first webcams around 2001 in three exhibits. Today, there are eight webcams, including a seasonal one that was just made live in the penguin nursery (check it out here) where you can watch Magellanic Penguin chicks generally being their cute, fluffy selves, flapping their wings and more at any given time of day from your phone or computer. The aquarium offers a guide for citizens to build a more climate-resilient Long Beach, based on its collaborative effort with Southern California-based universities, regional and city governmental agencies and local businesses on the Living Building Challenge and the Aquaponics Program, which has resulted in twenty schools experimenting with aquaponics, a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics.

{"prefix": "Born Wet, Human Babies Are 75 Percent Water. Then Comes The Drying : Krulwich Wonders... A fresh tomato is 93.5 percent water. A fresh baby girl or boy is 75 percent water. A banana, 74 percent. We all start wet, and then, inevitably, dry. A 1-year-old baby carries 10 percent less water; a male adult 15 percent less. Life is a slow evaporation, with some curious exceptions.\nLovely, no? Now think of this baby abstractly \u2014 as a sack of hundreds of millions of atoms. Here's the atomic formula for a new human being, arranged by elements, according to scientist Neil Shubin.\nNotice that the two most plentiful atoms are H (hydrogen) and O (oxygen) which shouldn't be a big surprise, since 2 H's and an O make water, and we humans are very moist, especially when we're born.\nIt turns out, a brand new human baby is 75 percent water.\nWe're born as wet as a fresh potato. Tomatoes are wetter (93.5 percent water). Apples, too, but only slightly (80 percent). Check out this fruit vs. baby comparison.\nOK, we aren't as wet as watermelons (who'd want to be?), but still, we begin our lives as noisy dewdrops that will one day learn to crawl, then walk. As science writer Loren Eiseley once put it, people \"are a way that water has of going about, beyond the reach of rivers.\"\nBut then, with every step we take, we begin to dry. The longer we live, the drier we get. One year after birth, a human baby is only 65 percent water \u2013 a ten percent drop, says the U.S. Geological Survey.\nBabies are wetter than children. By the time we're adults, the USGS says, adult men are about 60 percent water, adult women 55 percent. Elderly people are roughly half water.\nThere are variations, of course. The more buff you are (muscle tissue stores more water) the wetter you are. Because women generally have more fat cells, they tend to be a bit drier. Fat cells aren't as moist.

Then Comes The Drying : Krulwich Wonders... A fresh tomato is 93.5 percent water. A fresh baby girl or boy is 75 percent water. A banana, 74 percent. We all start wet, and then, inevitably, dry. A 1-year-old baby carries 10 percent less water; a male adult 15 percent less. Life is a slow evaporation, with some curious exceptions. Lovely, no? Now think of this baby abstractly \u2014 as a sack of hundreds of millions of atoms. Here's the atomic formula for a new human being, arranged by elements, according to scientist Neil Shubin. Notice that the two most plentiful atoms are H (hydrogen) and O (oxygen) which shouldn't be a big surprise, since 2 H's and an O make water, and we humans are very moist, especially when we're born. It turns out, a brand new human baby is 75 percent water. We're born as wet as a fresh potato. Tomatoes are wetter (93.5 percent water). Apples, too, but only slightly (80 percent). Check out this fruit vs. baby comparison. OK, we aren't as wet as watermelons (who'd want to be?), but still, we begin our lives as noisy dewdrops that will one day learn to crawl, then walk. As science writer Loren Eiseley once put it, people \"are a way that water has of going about, beyond the reach of rivers.\" But then, with every step we take, we begin to dry. The longer we live, the drier we get. One year after birth, a human baby is only 65 percent water \u2013 a ten percent drop, says the U.S. Geological Survey. Babies are wetter than children. By the time we're adults, the USGS says, adult men are about 60 percent water, adult women 55 percent. Elderly people are roughly half water. There are variations, of course. The more buff you are (muscle tissue stores more water) the wetter you are. Because women generally have more fat cells, they tend to be a bit drier. Fat cells aren't as moist. The water that lubricates your joints, flushes your waste (I'm talking about pee), assists seminal reproduction, and absorbs shocks to your bones \u2014 as you age, the moisturizer in you slowly dwindles.

In the past, scientists focused on methane plumes in the Arctic, as well as increasing water temperatures on the ocean\u2019s surfaces. The recent data on methane plumes shows that deep water has had significant temperature spikes due to climate change. Luckily, much of the methane is eaten up by bacteria or converted into carbon dioxide. But we can\u2019t assume this will be the case forever, as climate change continually affects our planet from year to year. \u201cCurrent environmental changes in Washington and Oregon are already impacting local biology and fisheries, and these changes would be amplified by the further release of methane,\u201d Johnson said. Mankind is triggering another Permian extinction. There won't be any humans left (thankfully for Earth) but hopefully Earth will recover from this one. I'd estimate at least ten million years to get rid of the worst toxins, pollutants and radiation that humanity has blanketed the Earth with. The Permian mass extinction that occurred 250 million years ago, also known as the \"Great Dying,\" was triggered by a massive lava flow in an area of Siberia that led to an increase in global temperatures of 6 degrees Celsius. That, in turn, caused the melting of frozen methane deposits under the seas (the same volcanism was also thought to have triggered massive methane release from bacteria in the oceans) Released into the atmosphere, those gases caused temperatures to skyrocket further. All of this occurred over a period of approximately 80,000 years. The change in climate is thought to be the key to what caused the extinction of Then the Permian extinction that occurred in Canada. \u201cClimate change may take 100,000 years to alter the plumes,\u201d said Joe Johnson, an oceanographer with the University of Washington. The oceans hold about 73 percent of the world's carbon reservoirs. But if we humans decide to take advantage of this resource, there are many things we have to work out first.

When you&apos;ve shifted more than two million cars in the UK alone since 1980 it would seem folly to opt for anything else.\nFrom this weekend, the fifth generation of the Ellesmere Port-built car hits the road, and few other than Vauxhall aficionados are likely to recognise this latest Astra from its predecessor.\nNot to put too fine a point on it, this is a critically important launch for Vauxhall.

She then went on to serve in the Israel Defense Forces as a physical trainer, where she whipped IDF soldiers into shape.\nWhile Refaeli was exempt from the draft because she was married at the time she would have been compelled to serve (Israel exempts married women from the armed services), Gadot served her two-year mandatory service.\nGadot has not been shy about her support of the IDF.

Her own standalone comic launched this past March.\nDafne Keen's turn as the young mutant Laura -- AKA X-23 -- was a standout of Fox's late winter hit \"Logan,\" and could easily headline her own film.

But after scoring the role of Wonder Woman in 2013, Gadot shot up to the top of the list. Gadot got her start as a model, winning the Miss Israel pageant in 2004. She then went on to serve in the Israel Defense Forces as a physical trainer, where she whipped IDF soldiers into shape. While Refaeli was exempt from the draft because she was married at the time she would have been compelled to serve (Israel exempts married women from the armed services), Gadot served her two-year mandatory service. Gadot has not been shy about her support of the IDF. During 2014\u2019s conflict between Israel and Gaza, she caused a bit of a stir around the world when she uploaded a photograph of herself praying with her daughter Alma. The post garnered an impressive 200,000 \u201clikes\u201d as well as about 19,000 comments, both in support of her position and against it. But, according to Colter, it only made her more popular in Israel. Her support of Israel has also become a sticking point. On Wednesday, a theater chain in Lebanon, an enemy of Israel, announced that \u201cWonder Woman\u201d had been banned in Lebanon. But that obviously hasn\u2019t hurt her at home, where she\u2019s seen as down to earth. But now Israel is enjoying the dawn of Gadot. \u201cShe\u2019s a mensch,\u201d he added. \"Wonder Woman\" is the first big budget, female-fronted superhero film since 2005, and the first of the current era of comic-book blockbusters, but it hopefully won't be the last. As the film directed by Patty Jenkins and starring Gal Gadot shapes up to be a likely big hit for Warner bros, here are some other female superheroes that should get their own stand-alone films. Fan favorite Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) has been a major part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2010's \"Iron Man 2,\" but it's about time the assassin-turned-Avenger headlines her own solo film. Kamala Khan, AKA Ms. Marvel, is Marvel Comic's first female Muslim superhero, and a huge success for the publisher among fans and critics. She'd make a great addition to the increasingly diverse Marvel Cinematic Universe too. Evangeline Lilly will portray The Wasp next up in \"Ant-Man & The Wasp,\" but the character has plenty of comic book history separate from Ant-Man to make up at least a few solo adventures. The second Miss America in the comics would be Marvel's first Latina and LGBTQ superhero onscreen. Her own standalone comic launched this past March. Dafne Keen's turn as the young mutant Laura -- AKA X-23 -- was a standout of Fox's late winter hit \"Logan,\" and could easily headline her own film. The idea even got support from \"Logan\" director James Mangold. \"I thought she was just such a great character, but with what Dafne did, I think that certainly that's possible,\" said Mangold. Zatanna would be DC's answer to Marvel's \"Doctor Strange\" -- she's both a stage magician and a real sorceress. She's set to appear in the still in-development \"Justice League Dark,\" which could serve as a springboard for a stand alone story. One of DC's earliest ally of Diana Prince, AKA Wonder Woman, the Amazon princess would make for a great partner to Diana in her own film.

The honoree said he was flattered. \"I guess it's an auspicious moment for me because I've been around now about 20 years, and to have young musicians and young artists, young writers acknowledge that you're even still around is more than I could have asked for 20 years ago,\" Mr. Yoakam said. A 32-year-old musician named Brian Culbertson, with eight albums behind him already, has the kind of career that many performers envy. He received the jazz award from the organization of young musicians. The son of a trumpet player, he started with piano at age eight, then moved on to drums, trombone, and other instruments. \"And from then on, I just buried my self in the basement with a couple of keyboards and just worked as much as I could,\" Mr. Culbertson said. While attending De Paul University in Chicago, he sent a tape to the father of a friend who worked for a record company. \"And he called me back and said, hey, when can you finish a whole record? I'm like, Oh my God. I'm freaking out. I'm still in college,\" he added. Brian Culbertson released his first album at 21, and has been turning out recordings and touring ever since then, playing a style of music called \"smooth jazz.\" His latest album is titled Hookin' Up. Jarvee Hutcherson is national president of the American Society of Young Musicians. Its members, in 18 chapters around the United States, are students or young professionals - rockers, rappers, jazz musicians and country singers. He says too many young performers succumb to drugs and alcohol, and that is something the society helps them with. \"We assist young musicians with scholarships, musicians that have problems, housing problems, drug problems. And we're turning that around, and I think we've made great stride in putting musicians back on the right track,\" he said. The young musicians vote for award winners, selecting those whose careers have inspired them. This year's honorees include the rock band the Goo Goo Dolls, contemporary singer Josh Groban, Hip Hop artist Common and soul singer Jon Batiste. The American Society of Young Musicians is planning to present awards to an unspecified number of members in the next year. The society has joined with the California charity, Living Hope, to help Los Angeles-based artists start their careers. You can find out more about the society at its Web site.

Paramount is releasing the film in the exact same corridor that brought success in the last couple of years to two other, somewhat similar movies American Sniper and Lone Survivor, and like the latter film in particular, Bay has crafted a patriotic, riveting war movie full of intense action that also thankfully puts a human face on exactly what happened in Benghazi.\nretired Navy Seals and Marines now in their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, is basically a movie that puts its emphasis on the brave men who fought this battle rather than the ensuing political storm it is still causing as we enter this Presidential election year. Hillary Clinton and President Obama (not even mentioned) are not the focus here as in the political debate about what was done \u2013 or not done- in this incident. Rather, it is these six men who form a unit called Group Global Response or GGR there, to protect and provide security for whatever problems might come up. When U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens (Matt Letscher) goes out to visit the vulnerable outpost, a terrorist attack soon follows and he is killed, a victim of smoke inhalation, along with three others. With no American military in sight, the GGR tries to ride to the rescue but are thwarted by a superior named Bob ( David Costabile) and lose crucial time. Against his orders they go anyway. When they get there the place is in flames and the CIA Annex is likely the next target. What ensues is a very violent war film full of shooting and explosions, exactly the kind of thing we have come to expect from Bay films, but here in the context of a true story seems all too real, putting the audience right in the center of the action.\nIn many ways this movie, which really only wants to focus on the warrior, not the war, is like many others, but because it is likely to be used as a political football (and already has been on Fox News) the real point of it could be sadly lost. I hope it isn\u2019t because seeing this whole thing from the POV of the men who were on the front lines, much like The Alamo in some ways (there\u2019s even a reference to that), is compelling moviemaking and a real step forward into something a little more important than another Transformers movie for Bay.\nThe acting across the board is excellent with standouts being John Krasinski as a former Navy Seal who must abandon his family just one more time to take on an assignment he thought would be brief and uneventful.

{"prefix": "Reviewer. Journalist. Malay. Singapore. Daughter. Sister. Wife.\nThis self-labelling exercise was prompted by an intimate and thought-provoking one-man show performed by British-Indian playwright Joe Sellman- Leava about the comforts and limitations of labels.\nThe hour-long play sees labels with words such as \"BRITISH\", \"INDIAN\" and \"FOREIGN\" slapped onto his shirt (these are just the mentionables), while he tells his family history and tackles anti-immigrant rhetoric prevalent in his native Britain and elsewhere, including President-elect Donald Trump's America.\nThe main thrust of the play is that everyday occurrences of racism and easy labelling are not far removed from larger socio-political crises, such as countries tightening their borders.\nOverall, it is an effective and urgent call for people to make a greater effort in understanding the humanity that lies beyond a label.\nA versatile actor, Sellman-Leava plays multiple characters, from a young child who calls him \"ARABIAN\" on the street, to Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, who sings a nursery rhyme with the N-word in it, to Ugandan dictator Idi Amin to Trump.\nThe performances are great and he nails the accents, though he is surprisingly nervy when he speaks as himself.\nPerhaps due to deference, he never fully mimics the strongest character in the play - his father - citing the reason that he cannot do justice to his powerful voice.\nA Uganda-born Indian man who goes to Britain after being forced to flee his homeland during Amin's reign, Sellman-Leava's father ends up marrying a British woman and having three children.\nTo get a job more easily, he changes his surname from Patel to Sellman-Leava, which is a combination of his wife's maiden name and a subcaste in India from which the name Patel is derived. He switches accents depending on whom he is speaking to.\nThe richness of Sellman-Leava's family background is hard to convey when someone wants a simple answer to the question of where he is \"really from\".

Journalist. Malay. Singapore. Daughter. Sister. Wife. This self-labelling exercise was prompted by an intimate and thought-provoking one-man show performed by British-Indian playwright Joe Sellman- Leava about the comforts and limitations of labels. The hour-long play sees labels with words such as \"BRITISH\", \"INDIAN\" and \"FOREIGN\" slapped onto his shirt (these are just the mentionables), while he tells his family history and tackles anti-immigrant rhetoric prevalent in his native Britain and elsewhere, including President-elect Donald Trump's America. The main thrust of the play is that everyday occurrences of racism and easy labelling are not far removed from larger socio-political crises, such as countries tightening their borders. Overall, it is an effective and urgent call for people to make a greater effort in understanding the humanity that lies beyond a label. A versatile actor, Sellman-Leava plays multiple characters, from a young child who calls him \"ARABIAN\" on the street, to Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, who sings a nursery rhyme with the N-word in it, to Ugandan dictator Idi Amin to Trump. The performances are great and he nails the accents, though he is surprisingly nervy when he speaks as himself. Perhaps due to deference, he never fully mimics the strongest character in the play - his father - citing the reason that he cannot do justice to his powerful voice. A Uganda-born Indian man who goes to Britain after being forced to flee his homeland during Amin's reign, Sellman-Leava's father ends up marrying a British woman and having three children. To get a job more easily, he changes his surname from Patel to Sellman-Leava, which is a combination of his wife's maiden name and a subcaste in India from which the name Patel is derived. He switches accents depending on whom he is speaking to. The richness of Sellman-Leava's family background is hard to convey when someone wants a simple answer to the question of where he is \"really from\". Even more painful is when that same person deduces, quite wrongly, that \"he ain't English\". The show also draws the audience into the story by way of interaction. In one scene, he makes one female audience member read out messages sent to him by a revoltingly racist Tinder match. After learning about his bi-racial background, she mistakes his Internet speak for poor English language skills. The actual stick-on labels Sellman-Leava puts on himself could easily have been gimmicky, but become integral to the story as the play progresses. Strewn on the floor, they become bits of snow under his feet as he recounts his father - the latter being a metaphor for himself. This is a riveting and surprisingly moving piece of theatre that has the added effect of asking the question: What if our ancestors had been similarly self-labelled? Sellman-Leava's show premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland in 2015 under the title, \"Carole and Anthony\", and has since been translated into English.

Koke also just finished shooting the MTV Shuga: Down South season two preview that he co-presented with Bontle Modiselle. \"I have never worked with five cameras and an audience and this experience stretched me. I realised that presenting is a lot of work. It takes precise effort because you need to understand the etiquette to keep the viewer engaged.\" To further entrench his influence in fashion, Koke says he will be working on a blog to share his insights, as if that is not enough, he will also get into studio, and teases that his sound would have an indie feel and is inspired by the works of Una Rams, Frank Ocean, A-Reece, Nasty C, Riky Rick and Big Hash. Looking back over his career, Koke says he feels finally unchained to be his real self. \"Everyday I find a different purpose and with that comes growth.\" \"You want to do it well because people will look up to you for insights and it would be nice to make it part of your identity.

In day after day of publicly humiliating Sessions, Trump said he rued his decision to choose Sessions for his Cabinet. Trump's intensifying criticism has fueled speculation that the attorney general may step down even if the president stops short of firing him. But Sessions is showing no outward signs that he is planning to quit, and on Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that Trump \"wants him to lead the department.\" \"Look, you can be disappointed in someone and still want them to continue to do their job,\" she said. MS-13 is an international criminal enterprise with tens of thousands of members in several Central American countries and many U.S. states. The gang originated in immigrant communities in Los Angeles in the 1980s , when members started fleeing and then relocating to join gangs in El Salvador and other countries in Central America. Today, it also has members with no ties to Central America, mostly young men ages 15 to 25, who do not keep contact with their families. \"It's ruthless.

La Jolla should be more known as a dining and shopping destination. I would snap my fingers and make La Jolla a more pedestrian and outdoor-friendly dining town.

One such dispersal order was put in place following the stabbing of a 15-year-old boy in the city centre on Sunday, February 2. This meant officers could move on any groups hanging around in the city centre if it\u2019s suspected they could be a crime or anti-social behaviour threat. If those moved along came back, then they faced possibly being arrested. Coventry stabbing reaction: \"Where are the parents?\" The teenager was found with knife injuries to his leg and lower torso in Trinity Street shortly before 6pm and was taken to hospital. His injuries were not life-changing and he was released from hospital just hours later. Dispersal orders are not a new action that police can take, however they aren&apos;t always used. So we asked the Commander of Coventry Police, Chief Superintendent Mike O&apos;Hara, why one was used on Sunday and what came of it. Q: Why was this stabbing deemed serious enough to put the dispersal order in place? A: The stabbing was deemed serious enough by the duty Inspector on the evening to put the order in place, due to the fact that groups were congregating in the area. The groups soon dispersed following increased police presence in the area. Q: Was the order actually used by officers on Sunday or Monday to move anyone along or did it result in any arrests? A: I cannot confirm at this stage the specific details of the use of the order, however, previous use of the dispersal power has proven very effective in removing problematic individuals from the city centre and preventing potential issues. Officers have utilised search powers on numerous individuals in the area resulting in a drugs arrest. Q: Is the use of dispersal orders something you are now considering using more often in the wake of incidents like this? A: The use of the dispersal power is a very useful tool for officers in dealing with groups of youths when they feel that the criteria apply and the St Michaels area is deemed unsafe, that there is a threat of disorder or that large groups of people could be causing anti-social behaviour. What do you remember about the most famous murder investigation in Coventry?

{"prefix": "The morning before I attended the screening of the new X-Men movie, I was cleaning out an old box of mementos and came across an odd flyer. It read \u201cMutants Are People Too!\u201d on the cover. On the inner fold were details of how this country was full of Mutant Oppression and lacking Mutant Equality. I was given this flyer at the first screening of the original X-Men in 2000, when the studio staged a mock protest outside the theater. Actors made up as mutants handed out pamphlets and spoke out against the Senator Kelly character, played in the movie by Bruce Davison.\nIt\u2019s amazing (and maybe a little depressing) that there have been seven X-Men movies made in the past 14 years, and only a few of them are really good. The first two, directed by Bryan Singer, were made before the saturation of comic book movie adaptations we have today and remain impressive, thrilling and a lot of fun. The disappointing X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine were the underwhelming series lows, while the pretty good X-Men: First Class and the underrated The Wolverine mostly succeeded in capturing the gruff, imaginative essence of the series. Now, with Singer returning to direct a series installment for the first time since 2003, the franchise mostly escapes superhero movie fatigue by finding a brilliantly clever new angle to explore.\nThe complex plot opens with the world we know becoming a dark, dreary place in the near future. All mutants are hunted and killed by man-made machines called Sentinels and the X-Men crew is sparse and holed up in China, awaiting possible extinction. By a means too convoluted to explain, Logan (Hugh Jackman) is sent back in time to change the past.

I was given this flyer at the first screening of the original X-Men in 2000, when the studio staged a mock protest outside the theater. Actors made up as mutants handed out pamphlets and spoke out against the Senator Kelly character, played in the movie by Bruce Davison. It\u2019s amazing (and maybe a little depressing) that there have been seven X-Men movies made in the past 14 years, and only a few of them are really good. The first two, directed by Bryan Singer, were made before the saturation of comic book movie adaptations we have today and remain impressive, thrilling and a lot of fun. The disappointing X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine were the underwhelming series lows, while the pretty good X-Men: First Class and the underrated The Wolverine mostly succeeded in capturing the gruff, imaginative essence of the series. Now, with Singer returning to direct a series installment for the first time since 2003, the franchise mostly escapes superhero movie fatigue by finding a brilliantly clever new angle to explore. The complex plot opens with the world we know becoming a dark, dreary place in the near future.

As auto plants spring up across Mexico in cities like Celaya, San Luis Potosi, Monterrey, Salamanca and Saltillo, factories making electronics, tires and other automotive components are popping up, lining highways in central Mexico. \u201cIt\u2019s just a brutal knock-on effect. If you pass by Queretaro, it\u2019s one factory after another. And it\u2019s all auto parts,\u201d said PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 Lozano, who noted that some 550,000 people now work in some aspect of the nation\u2019s auto industry. About a third of all Japanese investment in Mexico now concentrates in the state of Aguascalientes, whose capital city of the same name has a population of about 1 million people. Garza de Vega, the state\u2019s head of economic development, said 70 Japanese companies have set up in the state, some in logistics, services and spare parts for machinery. A few billboards for real estate developments carry Japanese lettering. City officials estimate a Japanese population of about 1,100 people, enough families to fill the Japanese School of Aguascalientes, which goes through ninth grade. As Japanese kids sat on the floor eating their box lunches with chopsticks, a school employee, Jaime Gomez, said nearly everyone feels prosperity from the boom. \u201cThere\u2019s no unemployment in Aguascalientes. If you look for work, you will find it,\u201d Gomez said. Engineering departments at local universities \u201care saturated\u201d with local students hoping to get some of the higher paying jobs at the auto plants. Mexico\u2019s automotive industry is spread out, and analysts say that is a good thing. Ford has plants in Chihuahua and Sonora in the north as well as Morelos state near the capital. Puebla, near Mexico City, is hub of Germany\u2019s Volkswagen. Honda produces vehicles in Guanajuato state and near Guadalajara, both in central Mexico. Toyota builds Tacoma pickups in Tijuana at the border. General Motors makes pickups and the Cadillac Escalade in Silao in Guanajuato state as well as sedans in Coahuila state abutting Texas. \u201cCar plants have definitely brought some of these cities onto the map. If you look at Hermosillo and the role of the Ford plant, or the Nissan plant in Aguascalientes, it\u2019s made a big difference in those cities,\u201d said Guido Vildozo, who oversees Latin America for HIS Automotive, a consultancy. When Kia announced its new plant, which will begin making up to 300,000 cars a year in 2016, it chose a suburb of Monterrey, the northeastern industrial hub. In July, BMW said it would build a $1 billion plant in San Luis Potosi state, which will create 3,500 new jobs over the next three to seven years. And state officials say the plant will generate an additional $3.2 billion in income for the state. Despite a large work force, Mexico\u2019s auto plants have not yet adapted to the new flexibility of assembly lines that can turn out cars as needed, said Alberto Lopez, former director of Mexico\u2019s federal statistics agency. Today, that number is down to 165,000, although it\u2019s still a significant contributor to the economy, economists say. <sent> \u201cThe auto industry was a part of the national economy as it has always been.

Fultz even strives to express the shop\u2019s unique sensibilities through the drinks. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t normally find a peanut butter cup latte or a Mounds latte,\u201d she said. Cool Beans also features the best pumpkin spice around, she said. A unique combination of ingredients, it\u2019s definitely different from any other pumpkin spice to be found. And it\u2019s served year-round. The coffee is all local, she said, including one fair-trade option. She is working on adding another two or three fair trades in the coming months. The shop goes beyond teas and lattes, though, with a menu of muffins, cookies and sandwiches. All are homemade, she said, with only fresh ingredients. Everything is baked or prepared at the shop, she said, from the bread on the sandwiches to the blueberry muffins. Sandwiches are kept simple, she said, and offer most things a customer would find in a diner: from an egg sandwich or a bagel with cream cheese to a BLT or grilled cheese. The shop offers several different breads, including homemade white and focaccia breads. Cool Beans\u2019 baked goods are outstanding, she said, and a favorite with customers is the blueberry-banana. The company is looking for people to volunteer for taste-testing, she said. An outstanding-tasting muffin doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it will be a customer favorite. If someone doesn\u2019t like a particular type of muffin, they can request something not on the menu, she said. But it must meet a certain standard of quality before it can be added to the menu. She said the shop keeps about 15 different recipes on hand to provide variety. Even though the shop is not yet open for a full day\u2019s operation, it\u2019s opened a few hours a day and has become a favorite spot, she said.

The app is designed to make the process as fluid as possible, and it\u2019s all about finding the best deal. The app I normally use to book my own trips (when I even use an app instead of a website) is Expedia. Yet, I don\u2019t plan on going back to travel apps, and here\u2019s why.\nFirst, let\u2019s clear up one misconception. Making travel arrangements is not rocket science. There are a limited number of flights from Minneapolis to Las Vegas on the dates I\u2019m flying. For some reason, I always think if I spend an hour or more, I might find a better deal. That\u2019s rarely true.\nWhat is true is that most of the travel apps, even the ones that make big promises about saving you money, are searching the same basic airfare options. Sun Country offers roughly the same deal on every site, so a messaging app like Mezi already has a fairly limited number of options to analyze. From what I understand about how the app works, it searches for the best flights at the best times and provides three good options without too much help from a human agent.\nWhat\u2019s changed for me is that I trust the results. I know that these are likely the three best options, so I don\u2019t psyche myself out searching for more economical flights. It helps that I already know the flight should run about $300 or less (this is a vacation destination after all) and shouldn\u2019t make any stops.\nHere are some of the ways this saves me time. I don\u2019t have to use multiple travels apps and try to remember my login for each one. I don\u2019t have to fill out any forms \u2014 Mezi does that for me. I don\u2019t have to pick any flight preferences; Mezi saves this and fills it in. There are a few more subtle benefits, as well. I might need to update the Mezi app once in a while, but not as often as most of the apps I use, which seem to be constantly needing an update. Most of what needs to be updated in a messaging app is on the backend, not within the simple text interface.\nMaybe it\u2019s all an illusion, but I swear I saved about an hour.

Maybe it\u2019s easy to make a one-stop shopping trip, instead of making multiple trips. But whatever the case may be, Mezi\u2019s simplified experience should make it easier to avoid some unnecessary pain points and save time. You can browse the site by price (though I would recommend actually doing your research and comparing flights between your options and making sure that they\u2019re of the same price), and you can compare prices for multiple travel days. Once Mezi shows you the correct options, hit the submit button to move onto the next step. No human interaction or password entry. No waiting in long queues!

I'm guessing the rest of them will follow suit and pledge something similar. The question is: OK, so on January 20, 2017, you announce that we're out of the deal (since we're in the Republican fantasy world for the moment, let's put aside the involvement of Europe and the UN). What happens next? Well for starters, the Iranians would no longer be constrained by the things they agreed to. They could kick out all the inspectors and institute a crash program to create a nuclear weapon if they wanted. Are Republicans saying that Iran would never do that? I don't think so. Yet in practice, the Republican position seems to be: 1) We can never trust the Iranians to adhere to the terms of any nuclear deal we sign with them because of their insatiable thirst for nuclear weapons, so 2) If there's no agreement at all\u2014no limits on nuclear research, no limits on the quantity and purity of uranium they can enrich, no inspections\u2014then everything will be OK. To be clear, I'm not saying this deal is perfect, though a lot of people who know a lot about this issue are arguing that it's far stronger than what they expected (see here, for instance). But Republicans aren't saying we need to reopen negotiations and push for something better. They're just saying we should scrap the agreement, and then... well, they actually don't say what happens then. In effect, the Republican argument is, We've put this dangerous criminal in prison, but I don't think this prison is secure enough. He might escape! So the answer is to tear down the prison and let him go. Since this is something he'll want to do if he thinks he has a good chance of escaping, the Republicans\u2014as I will illustrate here\u2014believe we might even allow him to escape from the hole we put him in. But we must not allow any signs of normalcy or progress in his life\u2014things like paying off his legal bills (which could entail taking him on a luxurious hunting trip to Africa), teaching him simple mathematics, or giving him some well-meaning but useless lessons about how important it is to obey the law, or beginning a career in some field in which he's in high demand.

{"prefix": "Falling short in the World Series in consecutive years, perhaps a more bitter ending than not playing for the championship at all, offers the Dodgers front office one perk this early in the offseason.\nThere is plenty on the Dodgers\u2019 checklist as they begin reshaping the club over the next week. For starters, determining whether their face-of-the-franchise ace\u2019s future is in Los Angeles.\nClayton Kershaw originally had until Wednesday at 9 p.m. PT to opt out of the two years remaining on his contract. But Kershaw and the Dodgers agreed to extend the deadline to Friday at 1 p.m. PT, which offers more time to possibly come to terms on a deal that would keep Kershaw in Los Angeles for longer than the next two seasons.\nNeither offered specifics on the negotiations.\nThe club did remove one thing from its checklist Thursday, signing David Freese and saving $1 million doing it. The Dodgers held a $6 million team option to on Freese, but paid him a $500,000 bonus and then signed him to a one-year, $4.5-million deal.\nThe Dodgers have until 2 p.m. Friday to extend the one-year, $17.9 million qualifying offer to their free agents. Yasmani Grandal and Hyun-Jin Ryu are candidates to receive the offer. Manny Machado, another free agent, isn\u2019t eligible to receive the qualifying offer because he was traded during the season. If the offer is extended and declined, and the player signs elsewhere, the Dodgers would receive a compensatory pick in next June\u2019s draft.\nThe Dodgers have until 10 days after the season \u2014 Nov. 7 at 9 p.m. \u2014 to exercise the $1.1 million team option on manager Dave Roberts\u2019 contract. The Dodgers engaged Roberts in contract discussions during the season without reaching an agreement. Roberts has said he would like to return and the Dodgers have said they would like to retain him.\nOn Thursday, Friedman and Zaidi defended Roberts\u2019s decision-making during the World Series, particularly in Game 4 when he pulled pitcher Rich Hill in the seventh inning with a four-run lead after Hill had held the Red Sox scoreless over 6 1/3 innings.\nFriedman and Zaidi attributed the team\u2019s troubles in the World Series to the offense\u2019s struggles. Machado was acquired during the regular season to help the Dodgers avoid those spells, but the shortstop went 4 for 22 with a walk and zero extra-base hits in the five games while adding to his reputation as someone allergic to hustling. Machado is expected to sign a mega contract this winter as either a shortstop or third baseman.\nThe Dodgers have third baseman Justin Turner under contract for $39 million the next two seasons and are \u201coptimistic\u201d that Corey Seager, whose injuries created the hole at shortstop that Machado filled, will be ready for Opening Day next spring. Seager has undergone elbow ligament replacement and hip surgeries. A return to Los Angeles for Machado is unlikely.\nTo retain Machado \u2014 or sign slugger Bryce Harper or any other marquee free agent \u2014 would almost certainly require the Dodgers to surpass the luxury tax threshold. That\u2019s a line they mindfully dropped under in 2018. Asked whether the front office had been approved to venture into that territory, Friedman was coy.\nNow the onus is on Friedman and Zaidi to reconfigure the club over the next few months and place it in the best position to return to", "gen_completion": " its winning ways.\nRookie reliever Alex Verdugo has emerged as a possible addition to the Dodgers\u2019 starting rotation next spring. The 19-year-old Verdugo, selected seventh overall by Los Angeles in the 2017 amateur draft, went 1-7 in his first year in Los Angeles. However, Zaidi said discussions with doctors overseeing the young reliever\u2019s rehab from two Tommy John surgeries have run smoothly so far. If the reports and simulations from the Dodgers doctors and the Red Sox doctors turn out to be true, Verdugo might end up returning next spring as part of the team\u2019s five staff rotation alongside Tony Gonsolin, Kenta Maeda and Walker Buehler. Because Verdugo signed out of the Dominican Republic at $5.1 million, that would make him the Dodgers\u2019 top minor-league prospects behind Maeda and Buehler.

There is plenty on the Dodgers\u2019 checklist as they begin reshaping the club over the next week. For starters, determining whether their face-of-the-franchise ace\u2019s future is in Los Angeles. Clayton Kershaw originally had until Wednesday at 9 p.m. PT to opt out of the two years remaining on his contract. But Kershaw and the Dodgers agreed to extend the deadline to Friday at 1 p.m. PT, which offers more time to possibly come to terms on a deal that would keep Kershaw in Los Angeles for longer than the next two seasons. Neither offered specifics on the negotiations. The club did remove one thing from its checklist Thursday, signing David Freese and saving $1 million doing it. The Dodgers held a $6 million team option to on Freese, but paid him a $500,000 bonus and then signed him to a one-year, $4.5-million deal. The Dodgers have until 2 p.m. Friday to extend the one-year, $17.9 million qualifying offer to their free agents. Yasmani Grandal and Hyun-Jin Ryu are candidates to receive the offer. Manny Machado, another free agent, isn\u2019t eligible to receive the qualifying offer because he was traded during the season. If the offer is extended and declined, and the player signs elsewhere, the Dodgers would receive a compensatory pick in next June\u2019s draft. The Dodgers have until 10 days after the season \u2014 Nov. 7 at 9 p.m. \u2014 to exercise the $1.1 million team option on manager Dave Roberts\u2019 contract. The Dodgers engaged Roberts in contract discussions during the season without reaching an agreement. Roberts has said he would like to return and the Dodgers have said they would like to retain him. On Thursday, Friedman and Zaidi defended Roberts\u2019s decision-making during the World Series, particularly in Game 4 when he pulled pitcher Rich Hill in the seventh inning with a four-run lead after Hill had held the Red Sox scoreless over 6 1/3 innings. Friedman and Zaidi attributed the team\u2019s troubles in the World Series to the offense\u2019s struggles. Machado was acquired during the regular season to help the Dodgers avoid those spells, but the shortstop went 4 for 22 with a walk and zero extra-base hits in the five games while adding to his reputation as someone allergic to hustling. Machado is expected to sign a mega contract this winter as either a shortstop or third baseman. The Dodgers have third baseman Justin Turner under contract for $39 million the next two seasons and are \u201coptimistic\u201d that Corey Seager, whose injuries created the hole at shortstop that Machado filled, will be ready for Opening Day next spring. Seager has undergone elbow ligament replacement and hip surgeries. A return to Los Angeles for Machado is unlikely. To retain Machado \u2014 or sign slugger Bryce Harper or any other marquee free agent \u2014 would almost certainly require the Dodgers to surpass the luxury tax threshold. That\u2019s a line they mindfully dropped under in 2018. Asked whether the front office had been approved to venture into that territory, Friedman was coy. Now the onus is on Friedman and Zaidi to reconfigure the club over the next few months and place it in the best position to return to Once they\u2019ve done that, they will turn to next spring\u2019s training roster, which the Dodgers will open with an eye toward possibly converting some of the players who contributed to the season\u2019s disappointment into future assets. Among the players who were mentioned as possible additions to the starting rotation is 19-year-old right-hander Alex Verdugo. Selected seventh overall in the first round of the 2017 draft, Verdugo went 1-7 in 13 starts with the Dodgers this season. But Zaidi said the Dodgers\u2019 talks with the surgeons who performed Verdugo\u2019s two Tommy John elbow reconstructions have gone well. If reports from the Dodgers\u2019 and Red Sox\u2019s doctors prove accurate, Verdugo could be a candidate to join the rotation along with Tony Gonsolin, Kenta Maeda and Walker Buehler. <sent> The plan is to rotate Verdugo and Maeda before the start of the </sent>", "output": ["Once they\u2019ve done that, they will turn to next spring\u2019s training roster, which the Dodgers will open with an eye toward possibly converting some of the players who contributed to the season\u2019s disappointment into future assets.
