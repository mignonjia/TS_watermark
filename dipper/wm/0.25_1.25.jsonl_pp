Following the 2005 explosion, federal investigators pointed to BP's problematic safety culture -- for example, with managers who were \"checking off boxes\" rather than promoting best practices for safety -- as the cause of the plant's many safety problems. BP failed to respond and paid dearly for its inaction in 2010, when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, killing 11 and spilling more than 3 million barrels of oil. The incident cost the company $54 billion in damages.\nAs BP's record illustrates, organizational culture matters a great deal to employee safety.

Alex, who turns 12 on Tuesday, flew out on a pre-agreed trip with Melanie Batty, 37, and David Batty, 58, for a week-long stay in the Benahavis area, near Marbella. However they did not come back home as expected on Sunday October 8. Inquiries have revealed they may have tried to sail on the same date from Malaga to Melilla on the Moroccan border. Alex's guardian, grandmother Susan Caruana, 62, says her daughter and ex-husband previously lived on a commune in Morocco with Alex in 2014 as part of an \"alternative lifestyle\" which she believes lies behind the youngster's disappearance. She said: \"On the Sunday, they were due back in the afternoon and my husband was going to go and pick them up. I got this message on Facebook and it was a YouTube video of the three of them. \"They all spoke on it and Melanie said the reasons why they had done what they had done. \"Alex said it was a million times better being with his mum and granddad. Obviously it hurt me a bit but then my other concerns kicked in. \"The reason I believe they have done this is because basically my lifestyle, my belief systems, are not what they agree with - just simply living day to day, how normal people do. \"They didn't want him to go to school, they don't believe in mainstream school.\" She added: \"I just want to say to my grandson Alex, I love you so much and please, please just get in contact. \"We always did something nice with him on his birthday. We'd have a party or go bowling with his friends, his cousins and all the family. \"Then he started to refuse to eat normal food, go to school and see his friends.\" Salome Al Attar, from Alcolea, said her sister, Noa, 16, had a stomach complaint in 2014. \"After she came back from France, where she'd gone to try to find answers, she seemed much better. \"Then one summer day, I was with her, and I had a fainting attack and went to the ambulance station the next day and they thought it was a chest infection.\" Another symptom was that she was having a lot of bleeding from her gums and pain in her jaws.

The Last of Us: Remastered is dropping on the PlayStation 4 tomorrow. The new version includes increased visual fidelity, better graphics enhancements, as well as native 1920 x 1080p. Naughty Dog also took an opportunity to boost up the game's frame-rate from the barely-hitting-30 frames per second on the PlayStation 3 to 60 buttery frames per second on the PlayStation 4. Naughty Dog decided to leverage the power of the PlayStation 4 to up the core specs of the award-winning 2013 outing from Sony. The Last of Us Remastered includes all the previously released content for the game, including the DLC and add-ons that found a kind home on the PlayStation 3. Players will get the extra content for free, including the single-player and multiplayer content. There have also been rumors that new DLC is being planned to release for both the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4 versions of the game at some point down the line. The DLC is supposed to be a brand new multiplayer map pack that will extend the replay for players who like to get competitive against one another in the online portion of the game. For those of you who don't know what The Last of Us is about, the game follows Joel and Ellie as they trek across America to Baltimore. Joel is an older guy who suffered through some terrible tragedies 20 years prior to the game's time frame where the current events take place.

A 27-year-old woman was also injured in the attack, but she managed to escape along with upstairs tenants as a fire consumed the building.\nOn Feb. 4, the Broome County District Attorney's Office offered to settle a recent set of felony charges against Pica-Torres \u2014 burglary, grand larceny and criminal mischief \u2014 by a guilty plea to a misdemeanor petit larceny in Binghamton City Court. A prearranged sentence would be jail time served and three years of probation, and the felonies would be dismissed to satisfy that outcome.\nOn Feb. 7, with those charges to be resolved, prosecutors asked judges in Broome County and City of Binghamton courts to release Pica-Torres from jail on his own recognizance to await his next court date.

The day before Wilfredo Pica-Torres allegedly murdered a Binghamton man and set fire to a Walnut Street house, he was released from the Broome County jail to await sentencing on a larceny charge. Pica-Torres, 45, of 107 Walnut St., Apt. 1, is accused of killing 61-year-old Victor Banayan on Feb. 9 in an apartment at 109 Walnut St. on Binghamton's West Side. A 27-year-old woman was also injured in the attack, but she managed to escape along with upstairs tenants as a fire consumed the building. On Feb. 4, the Broome County District Attorney's Office offered to settle a recent set of felony charges against Pica-Torres \u2014 burglary, grand larceny and criminal mischief \u2014 by a guilty plea to a misdemeanor petit larceny in Binghamton City Court. A prearranged sentence would be jail time served and three years of probation, and the felonies would be dismissed to satisfy that outcome. On Feb. 7, with those charges to be resolved, prosecutors asked judges in Broome County and City of Binghamton courts to release Pica-Torres from jail on his own recognizance to await his next court date. On Feb. 8, he was released from jail. That legal step, and the timing of Pica-Torres' murder arrest so soon after being released, sparked criticism Wednesday from Paul Battisti, a Binghamton lawyer campaigning for Broome County district attorney.

The engineers included new work benches and tool cabinets to create a more productive workspace. In addition, the space boasts a new locker room and two new break areas. The room has improved lighting and the open floor plan offers flexibility to modify the space to meet the needs of future workload. The 30,000-square-foot enclosure boasts a raised floor that can be easily reconfigured for changing mission needs and is certified according to aerospace quality standards and electrostatic .

But only a year ago, she was a relative unknown whose audiences were rooted mainly in YouTube subscriptions.\nKelly, who auditioned for American Idol's ninth season as a teenager in 2010, was cut from the show just before the its live semi-finals after some particularly harsh criticism from judge Simon Cowell. While the rejection hit Kelly hard, she told Ryan Seacrest last year it incited her to buckle down on her craft and prove her worth as a musician.\n\"I was bummed when I got cut, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then it was kind of awesome because, I think, by getting cut from the show, something stirred up in me to want to write.\"\nAnd that's precisely what she did.

At the 2015 Billboard Music Awards, and armed with only an acoustic guitar, she tore through \"Nobody Love,\" her debut album's first single, and delivered what was generally considered to be the show's most striking performance. Unbreakable Smile's release a month later was proof of the broadcast's power \u2014 the LP debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and \"Nobody Love,\" which peaked inside Billboard's Top 20, was certified gold.

This is my favorite song of hers.\"\nThose early 2015 tunes were all produced by Kelly, who still was largely content to write and sing her own songs. She said she \"isn't even going to lie\" when she said she was surprised at how popular her debut album had been \u2014 she said she had never expected it to achieve much commercial success. \"I was making a lot of my stuff at 16 anyway,\" she said. \"I had no intention of pushing out a record or a EP like that because, that was for me, for myself.\"\n\"This Is My Town\" is a full-blown", "paraphrase_outputs": {"lex_40_order_100": {"final_input": "lexical = 40, order = 100 By Monday night, 23-year-old Tori Kelly might be in possession of her very first Grammy.

While the rejection hit Kelly hard, she told Ryan Seacrest last year it incited her to buckle down on her craft and prove her worth as a musician. \"I was bummed when I got cut, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then it was kind of awesome because, I think, by getting cut from the show, something stirred up in me to want to write.\" And that's precisely what she did. In 2012, after releasing six-track EP Handmade Songs By Tori Kelly that Kelly, herself, produced in her bedroom, the singer caught Scooter Braun's eye, and found herself under Capitol Records' management within the year. A second EP, Foreword, continued to cultivate a fan base, and demonstrated her appeal as a complete, wild-maned package. It was 2015, though, that signaled Kelly's rise into official breakthrough artist territory. At the 2015 Billboard Music Awards, and armed with only an acoustic guitar, she tore through \"Nobody Love,\" her debut album's first single, and delivered what was generally considered to be the show's most striking performance. Unbreakable Smile's release a month later was proof of the broadcast's power \u2014 the LP debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and \"Nobody Love,\" which peaked inside Billboard's Top 20, was certified gold. By pairing an enduring singer-songwriter sound with more explosive tracks like \"Expensive,\" Kelly honored her most devoted fans while opening herself up to a more mainstream audience. \"Should've Been Us,\" released next, also went gold. As pop began to embrace Kelly's relaxed attitude and penchant for producing radio-worthy hits, she reminded everyone with a tribute to Smokey Robinson at the 2015 BET Awards that she was, at her core, a soul artist. Fans \u2014 old and new \u2014 went wild on Twitter after her rendition of \"Who's Lovin You.\" Even Snoop Dogg, who watched the telecast from his Los Angeles home, had kind words for Kelly. \"She's been my favorite since I first started listening to records. Since the moment she did 'Nobody Love' on American Idol. I've been a fan ever since.\u201d \"She's got an amazing voice, and her music is amazing. I love this song she sang right here.\u201d On her most recent EP, and the first cuts on Unbreakable Smile, Kelly produced every one of her tracks, and continued to take great care to write and sing her own songs. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you,\u201d she said, speaking about her album's success and the fact that she had never expected such a brisk commercial reception. \u201cI made a lot of my music when I was 16.\u201d <sent> \"I had no intention of pushing out a record or a EP like that because, that was for me, for myself.\" \"This Is My Town\" is a full-blown </sent>", "output": ["telecast from his Los Angeles home, had kind words for Kelly. \"She's been my favorite since I first started listening to records.

It means a hacker could -- from far away -- force a Mac into a coma. Personal, corporate or government Macs could be spied on in a way that even the best security checks wouldn't discover -- until it's way too late. \"This is scary,\" said Sarah Edwards, a forensic analyst at the SANS Institute who specializes in reviewing computers for evidence of hacks. \"I would never see this. There could be funky stuff going on in the computer system, and I would never know why.\" What makes this one so bad? It's a computer bug that runs especially deep in the machine. All computers have some kind of basic input/output system (BIOS), the core program that brings a machine to life. It's the kind of thing you should never tamper with. And it should obviously remain heavily guarded. But Macs purchased one year ago or before, apparently, leave a door open. When a Mac goes into sleep mode and wakes back up, it allows direct access to the BIOS. It's a weird quirk that lets someone tamper with the code there.

In commitment to our Constitution, our nation has placed great priority on a dedication to this well-guarded peace. Similarly, over the past fifty years, Department of Defense innovation and technology has made our military the most technologically advanced in the world. Now, in the 21st century, dedication to harnessing top-of-the-line technology is even more necessary.\nWe live in a post 9/11 society. We\u2019ve known for some time now that there are those who actively seek to do our nation harm by targeting our buildings, our city streets, and public events. We also know that terrorist organizations are actively pursuing chemical, nuclear, and biological weaponry. Quite simply, there are those who want to hurt America and rob us of our freedoms.\nOur Founding Fathers knew that these freedoms were so precious that they were worth protecting and worth defending. They also knew, as we know today, that one of the realities of having these freedoms is that there will always be individuals who want to take them from us. To lack vigilance in our investment in national security fails a central tenet of our constitutional duty \u2013 outlined in the first sentence of the Constitution \u2013 to provide for the common defense.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that reconciling defense spending with our rapidly increasing national debt and deficit is a big task. Admiral Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has called our national debt this country\u2019s \u201cbiggest national security threat.\u201d There is plenty of waste at the Pentagon and we need to do our due diligence in making sure every defense dollar is treated as an investment. That\u2019s why I have supported legislation to audit the Department of Defense to ensure that every taxpayer dollar is well spent. However, we cannot use the national debt as an excuse to jeopardize our national security. Washington can \u2013 and must \u2013 get its fiscal house in order without cheapening our national security.\nToday, the danger of eroding our defense budget stretches beyond the battlefield. The ripple effects don\u2019t just touch our men and women in uniform, federal workers or defense civilians. The losses impact every rung of the American way of life \u2013 from Americans providing for their families by heading to work every day, to cheering spectators at a marathon.\nThis", "gen_completion": " challenge calls upon me to re-join the full, bipartisan coalition that supported the fiscal responsibility measures we approved before the current federal budget crisis began. Unfortunately for us, the Washington political system is not fully capable of responsibly cutting our spending, leaving it at this year\u2019s budget levels and increasing taxes. Unfortunately for us, our opposition has blocked meaningful spending reductions from taking place.

In commitment to our Constitution, our nation has placed great priority on a dedication to this well-guarded peace. Similarly, over the past fifty years, Department of Defense innovation and technology has made our military the most technologically advanced in the world. Now, in the 21st century, dedication to harnessing top-of-the-line technology is even more necessary. We live in a post 9/11 society. We\u2019ve known for some time now that there are those who actively seek to do our nation harm by targeting our buildings, our city streets, and public events. We also know that terrorist organizations are actively pursuing chemical, nuclear, and biological weaponry. Quite simply, there are those who want to hurt America and rob us of our freedoms. Our Founding Fathers knew that these freedoms were so precious that they were worth protecting and worth defending. They also knew, as we know today, that one of the realities of having these freedoms is that there will always be individuals who want to take them from us. To lack vigilance in our investment in national security fails a central tenet of our constitutional duty \u2013 outlined in the first sentence of the Constitution \u2013 to provide for the common defense. There\u2019s no doubt that reconciling defense spending with our rapidly increasing national debt and deficit is a big task. Admiral Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has called our national debt this country\u2019s \u201cbiggest national security threat.\u201d There is plenty of waste at the Pentagon and we need to do our due diligence in making sure every defense dollar is treated as an investment. That\u2019s why I have supported legislation to audit the Department of Defense to ensure that every taxpayer dollar is well spent. However, we cannot use the national debt as an excuse to jeopardize our national security. Washington can \u2013 and must \u2013 get its fiscal house in order without cheapening our national security. Today, the danger of eroding our defense budget stretches beyond the battlefield. The ripple effects don\u2019t just touch our men and women in uniform, federal workers or defense civilians. The losses impact every rung of the American way of life \u2013 from Americans providing for their families by heading to work every day, to cheering spectators at a marathon. This the challenge at hand. The challenge of reuniting the broad, bipartisan coalition that backed the fiscally responsible measures we passed before the current crisis. Unfortunately, Washington\u2019s political system has not yet been able to produce the responsible budget cuts we need to balance our budget. Unfortunately, our opposition has blocked any effort to achieve meaningful spending reductions. However, we have also failed to increase revenues by limiting deductions for upper-income Americans and leaving middle-class families to bear the cost of medical expenses. That\u2019s why, at the urging of the vice president-elect, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has committed to moving forward immediately on a jobs bill to grow the economy, which would provide a one-time check for every American and begin to address serious regulatory reforms that will spur job creation. <sent> If passed by Congress, these two steps \u2013 the Senate-passed tax relief package and the economic growth through the creation of new jobs </sent>", "output": ["the challenge at hand.

YORBA LINDA \u2013 For more than two decades the equestrians of Yorba Linda have been patient, and anchored themselves as the protected species of the city\u2019s historical heritage. Yorba Linda\u2019s equestrian community is unique in that most horses are backyard horses. The equine population resides from the west to the east, with nearly every breed of equine represented. The heaviest horse population is west of Fairmont Boulevard where spacious horse properties house the tradition of the old-time West. An act of protecting our semi-rural neighborhoods that brings the charm to our city is hovering over the General Plan, and the cowboys and cowgirls are the vigilant sentries of the equestrian heritage. As Yorba Linda began to develop on the east side, a major developer offered to include an equestrian center, which did not materialize. This developer however contributed $200,000 for a future center.

PFF said Fitzpatrick graded out the best of any Dolphins defender Sunday; he allowed just three completions in six attempts for 14 yards and had six tackles. Meanwhile, rookie linebacker Jerome Baker was decent, ranking the best of Miami\u2019s linebackers by PFF, 44th of 74 qualifiers. And a couple of other newcomers left positive impressions. Rookie kicker Jason Sanders made both of his field goal attempts ( 42 and 39 yards) to help the Dolphins improve to 3-0 at home, where they have allowed only 144 yards of total offense and have scored 40 points while allowing just seven. On defense, Myles Gaskin had five tackles, and the Titans managed only 144 yards of total offense. Ndamukong Suh was among the top five in the league among interior defensive linemen, and Suh had two sacks and a half-sack on a sack-fumble. The Dolphins allowed only 5.6 yards per carry. <sent> So, it\u2019s still early, but it\u2019s a start that has some Dolphin fans saying this team could contend for its first Super Bowl appearance. jmiller@pbpost.com @JustinMMiller To sign up for a free Dolphins newsletter, click here.

Boras, however, claimed that he is in Libya and is ready to become part of the political process - an announcement that stirred mixed reactions within Libya.\nMohammad al-Darrat, a member of the Tobruk-based Libyan House of Representatives (HoR), told Al Jazeera that Saif al-Islam's intention to run does not deserve any attention, asserting that the Gaddafis' regime is gone for good.\n\"If Saif al-Islam wants to return to power, what was the point of the revolution?\" said al-Darrat.\nHe added that international and regional powers are not interested in supporting his return since the former regime is gone and the world \"believes in interests rather than individuals\".\nPolitical analyst Kamel al-Merash thinks otherwise. He believes that not all Libyans can be put in one basket, arguing that while some oppose Saif al-Islam's plan to run, others support it.\nAl-Merash said no regional forces back Saif al-Islam directly but added that some would not object to a potential candidacy due to his popularity within Libya.\nSaleh Afihima, a member of the HoR and a supporter of \"Operation Dignity\" led by renegade General Khalifa Haftar, agrees with al-Merash.\nHe believes that no one can deny Saif al-Islam's constitutional right as a Libyan citizen, so long as there are no judicial restrictions to prevent him from running.\nIn 2013, a law was passed banning Gaddafi-era officials from holding public office. The law was later revoked in 2015.\nAguila Saleh, president of the HoR, said that as a Libyan citizen, Saif al-Islam has the right to run, since the lifting of the ban three years ago.\nHe added that unless prevented by judicial restrictions, the choice of his election is in the hands of Libyans.\nAfihima told Al Jazeera that Libyans need to recognise supporters of the former regime as part of the Libyan fabric, warning that intolerance towards any Libyan would have catastrophic consequences on the national reconciliation process.\nHe also said that all parties must adhere to democracy, without excluding opposing views, \"if we [Libyans] want to reach a real state\".\nThe Gaddafi regime still enjoys the support and loyalty of some tribes, especially in the south and the Warshefana region in Tripoli, as well as a number of tribes in Sirte, the birthplace of the late president.\nG", "gen_completion": "addafi was forced out of power by a military uprising in 2011 following years of war and bloodshed.

The announcement by Ayman Boras was made on Monday during a press conference in Tunisia, where the spokesman outlined Saif al-Islam's vision of \"restoring the Libyan state, making it for everyone\". Since his release from prison in June 2017, the whereabouts of Saif al-Islam has been unknown. Boras, however, claimed that he is in Libya and is ready to become part of the political process - an announcement that stirred mixed reactions within Libya. Mohammad al-Darrat, a member of the Tobruk-based Libyan House of Representatives (HoR), told Al Jazeera that Saif al-Islam's intention to run does not deserve any attention, asserting that the Gaddafis' regime is gone for good. \"If Saif al-Islam wants to return to power, what was the point of the revolution?\" said al-Darrat. He added that international and regional powers are not interested in supporting his return since the former regime is gone and the world \"believes in interests rather than individuals\". Political analyst Kamel al-Merash thinks otherwise. He believes that not all Libyans can be put in one basket, arguing that while some oppose Saif al-Islam's plan to run, others support it. Al-Merash said no regional forces back Saif al-Islam directly but added that some would not object to a potential candidacy due to his popularity within Libya. Saleh Afihima, a member of the HoR and a supporter of \"Operation Dignity\" led by renegade General Khalifa Haftar, agrees with al-Merash. He believes that no one can deny Saif al-Islam's constitutional right as a Libyan citizen, so long as there are no judicial restrictions to prevent him from running. In 2013, a law was passed banning Gaddafi-era officials from holding public office. The law was later revoked in 2015. Aguila Saleh, president of the HoR, said that as a Libyan citizen, Saif al-Islam has the right to run, since the lifting of the ban three years ago. He added that unless prevented by judicial restrictions, the choice of his election is in the hands of Libyans. Afihima told Al Jazeera that Libyans need to recognise supporters of the former regime as part of the Libyan fabric, warning that intolerance towards any Libyan would have catastrophic consequences on the national reconciliation process. He also said that all parties must adhere to democracy, without excluding opposing views, \"if we [Libyans] want to reach a real state\". The Gaddafi regime still enjoys the support and loyalty of some tribes, especially in the south and the Warshefana region in Tripoli, as well as a number of tribes in Sirte, the birthplace of the late president. G Saif al-Islam's brother, General Khalifa Haftar, a former ally of Gaddafi, led a campaign against the uprising, along with fighters from the United Arab Emirates. Libyan army spokesman Ibrahim Musaef welcomed Saif al-Islam's decision to run, saying that all Libyans, regardless of their sect or origin, have the right to run. <sent> \"The Libyan Constitution has set a timeframe and a procedure for electing a head of state,\" said Mussef. He added that those who are not allowed to run should be awarded government posts \"in line with the procedures\" outlined by the constitution. But Boras, the spokesman for Saif al-Islam, said that the election should proceed with caution to avoid any violations of the Constitution's article 31, which bans all states from the political and </sent>", "output": ["Saif al-Islam's brother, General Khalifa Haftar, a former ally of Gaddafi, led a campaign against the uprising, along with fighters from the United Arab Emirates.

You might think you only need a TV licence if you actually have a television, or only if you watch live TV at the same time as it&apos;s being broadcast, but it is NOT that simple. It&apos;s the first increase since 2010. But it won&apos;t be the last, with the Government announcing the licence fee will rise in line with inflation for five years. Here&apos;s everything you need to know about the increase including payment plans and when you don&apos;t have to pay for one. What date will it increase? The cost of a TV licence will increase on Saturday, April 1. It is the first time since 2010 that the price has changed. How much is it going up by? From April 1 a TV licence fee will be \u00a3147, the new figure is just \u00a31.50 more than the \u00a3145.50 cost we pay now. The government is responsible for setting price of the fee. Last year it was announced that it would rise, in line with inflation, for five years. Will my payment plan change? If you started a payment plan before April 1, 2017, you will continue to pay towards a licence fee of \u00a3145.50 until your licence is due to be renewed. It will be increased when the renewal starts. What is the fee used for? Everyone who owns a TV is required to pay the fee. The money goes towards funding the BBC - this includes radio stations and websites as well as programmes and watching things on iPlayer. ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and other stations run ad breaks in between their shows which is how they earn their money. This means they do not get a share of the licensing fee. The fee was started in 1946 to fund what was at the time the only television service in the UK. How can I tell if my licence is valid? You must keep your licence valid, which is why the fee is charged. If you forget to pay your licence fee it can be cancelled. Contact the BBC or the Government to renew it.

One can disagree with Theresa\u2019s prescription \u2014 a strategic role for the state to broaden economic opportunity, a clampdown on corporate excesses, rights for workers, intervention in dysfunctional markets and, through school reform, house-building and tax policy, a determination to make Britain the world\u2019s Great Meritocracy \u2014 but it is very difficult to disagree with her diagnosis.\nThat is why the Conservative manifesto, which I authored jointly with the brilliant Ben Gummer, rejected \u2018untrammelled free markets\u2019 and \u2018selfish individualism\u2019, and declared that \u2018our responsibility to one another is greater than the rights we hold as individuals\u2019. I was surprised to read some commentators describe these statements as \u2018left-wing\u2019 when the manifesto was consciously Burkean in its style and substance. Burke\u2019s great revelation was that if we value something, we must be prepared to reform it in order to keep it. I fear the election will cause many to conclude that we should return to the modern consensus politics of pure social and economic liberalism, which I believe is one of the causes of the division we see in Britain today.\nThe manifesto was later written off as \u2018the worst in history\u2019. One of the criticisms is that, instead of offering voters giveaways and bribes, we spelt out where cuts would fall.

We were wrong to do so. My biggest regret, however, is that we did not campaign in accordance with the insight that took Theresa to Downing Street in the first place. While the referendum result was undoubtedly an instruction for Britain to leave the EU, it was also a vote for change. One can disagree with Theresa\u2019s prescription \u2014 a strategic role for the state to broaden economic opportunity, a clampdown on corporate excesses, rights for workers, intervention in dysfunctional markets and, through school reform, house-building and tax policy, a determination to make Britain the world\u2019s Great Meritocracy \u2014 but it is very difficult to disagree with her diagnosis. That is why the Conservative manifesto, which I authored jointly with the brilliant Ben Gummer, rejected \u2018untrammelled free markets\u2019 and \u2018selfish individualism\u2019, and declared that \u2018our responsibility to one another is greater than the rights we hold as individuals\u2019. I was surprised to read some commentators describe these statements as \u2018left-wing\u2019 when the manifesto was consciously Burkean in its style and substance. Burke\u2019s great revelation was that if we value something, we must be prepared to reform it in order to keep it. I fear the election will cause many to conclude that we should return to the modern consensus politics of pure social and economic liberalism, which I believe is one of the causes of the division we see in Britain today. The manifesto was later written off as \u2018the worst in history\u2019. One of the criticisms is that, instead of offering voters giveaways and bribes, we spelt out where cuts would fall. While I accept that the manifesto might have been too ambitious, I worry that the implication of this argument is that politicians should not be straight with the electorate. But to be honest means not to ignore unpleasant truths; voters are intelligent creatures; they expect us to be honest with them. How do you persuade people, especially people on low incomes who are being crushed by economic insecurity, that you will protect the economy and keep taxes low without promising them tax cuts or benefits? They also believe that the election was partly decided by the voters\u2019 belief that the election was about something other than economics: that the election was a clash between the Conservatives and the left.

At rush hour, it could take double that or even more. With that in mind, nursing organisations are asking why would the Government be looking for a provision in a controversial new contract that would allow nurses working in Dublin to be moved between locations on opposite sides of the capital during a single shift, given the practical difficulties that may present. Nursing unions and public service management will on Tuesday attend the Labour Court in a bid to resolve differences on a new contract which have complicated and could even threaten the proposed settlement to the recent nurses\u2019 strike. The introduction of a new contract formed a key element of the original Labour Court recommendation that led to the suspension of the strike. Nurses had been seeking pay parity with other graduate-entry groups such as physiotherapists who, they maintained, earn about \u20ac7,000 a year more. Under the proposals, a new enhanced nurse grade would be introduced to which nurses could migrate after three years. Those moving on to the new grade would receive a salary increase of \u20ac2,439 or 7.3 per cent. The deal would also see significantly more nurses qualifying for additional allowances. However, there were also to be new cost-saving measures in a new contract to offset the cost of the proposed deal which could run to \u20ac50 million by the end of 2020. The Irish Nurses\u2019 and Midwives\u2019 Organisation (INMO) initially urged members to back the Labour Court recommendation. However, when the Government\u2019s contract proposals were leaked, they caused consternation. The Irish Times reported at the beginning of March that the Government wanted provisions to transfer nurses between locations \u2013 potentially within a 40km radius \u2013 for weeks at a time or even within a single shift. The Government proposals could also see nurses rostered to work shifts lasting four, six, eight, 10 or 12 hours. The INMO had seen the new contract as a potential opportunity to modernise nursing practices. However, it contended the Government proposals would actually worsen existing working arrangements. The proposals were rejected by both the INMO and Siptu. While Government representatives agreed to some changes in the proposals during direct talks with unions and at the Workplace Relations Commission, they insisted on retaining provision for the roster reforms and to move nurses between locations. This is the impasse that the Labour Court will seek to break this week. The question as to why the Government has insisted on such controversial changes which potentially could jeopardise an overall agreement has been debated widely in industrial relations circles in recent weeks. Some believe the Government\u2019s target in its contract proposals is not actually the nurses but rather the wider public service trade union movement. From the start of the process, the Government was determined a settlement to the nurses\u2019 dispute would not cause a breakdown in the existing public service accord, leading to a pay free-for-all across the State sector. However, the other public service unions have so far held off on launching their much-anticipated knock-on claims. But they have not gone away. They are watching developments very carefully to see how any eventual nurse settlement plays out. So what will the nurses have to give in productivity or work-practice changes in return for additional payments? Some senior industrial relations figures believe the Government is sending a message to the broader public service union movement that if nurse pay is settled, it will not budge on any other demands. No matter what the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s Labour Court hearing, the scale of the nursing dispute will be laid bare on Wednesday morning. Two-thirds of nurses are over the age of 50. Should the strike result in no settlement, how does the Government intend to fund the deficit that has already emerged and the deficit it will inevitably reveal this year?

{"prefix": "The first freshman class selected to Florida's state college system since Gov. Jeb Bush put an end to race-based admissions has shown, instead of a decrease in minority enrollment, an increase of 12 percent.\nMr. Bush, whose plan allows the admission of the top 20 percent of graduating seniors from each state high school, whether predominantly black, white or Hispanic, said the increase was proof that diversity in other college systems could be accomplished without affirmative action.\n''The most diverse in history,'' Mr. Bush said of the incoming freshmen, who are the first students to be admitted without affirmative action mandates since racial set-asides were put in place in Florida in 1978.\nHe said his plan, called One Florida, produced an incoming class of more than 40 percent minorities -- blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans -- and could be a model for other states whose affirmative action laws are being challenged in the courts or at the polls.\nBut critics of the plan say it is far too soon, after one year, to call the plan a success. Some experts on education reform called the new system a gimmick that simply gives affirmative action a new name.\nMr. Bush dismissed the criticism as he celebrated what he said was a clear victory in a difficult social and political arena. Black leaders here had said the plan would cripple college admissions of blacks.\n''I've spent the last 10 months getting blistered by people who didn't believe we could do this,'' Mr. Bush said.\nUnlike in Texas and California, which have similar programs that produced initial drops in minority enrollment, ''we did not wait for a legal challenge or a ballot initiative,'' said Mr. Bush.\nTexas courts threw out affirmative action laws in 1996, but the state eventually restored its racial mix on college campuses under a plan in Texas under Gov.

Jeb Bush put an end to race-based admissions has shown, instead of a decrease in minority enrollment, an increase of 12 percent. Mr. Bush, whose plan allows the admission of the top 20 percent of graduating seniors from each state high school, whether predominantly black, white or Hispanic, said the increase was proof that diversity in other college systems could be accomplished without affirmative action. ''The most diverse in history,'' Mr. Bush said of the incoming freshmen, who are the first students to be admitted without affirmative action mandates since racial set-asides were put in place in Florida in 1978. He said his plan, called One Florida, produced an incoming class of more than 40 percent minorities -- blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans -- and could be a model for other states whose affirmative action laws are being challenged in the courts or at the polls. But critics of the plan say it is far too soon, after one year, to call the plan a success. Some experts on education reform called the new system a gimmick that simply gives affirmative action a new name. Mr. Bush dismissed the criticism as he celebrated what he said was a clear victory in a difficult social and political arena. Black leaders here had said the plan would cripple college admissions of blacks. ''I've spent the last 10 months getting blistered by people who didn't believe we could do this,'' Mr. Bush said. Unlike in Texas and California, which have similar programs that produced initial drops in minority enrollment, ''we did not wait for a legal challenge or a ballot initiative,'' said Mr. Bush. Texas courts threw out affirmative action laws in 1996, but the state eventually restored its racial mix on college campuses under a plan in Texas under Gov. George W. Bush that admitted the top 10 percent of students in each school. Jeb Bush said he used elements of the Texas plan in his own. But it was California's end to affirmative action, in a statewide vote in 1997, that may have forced the Florida governor's hand. Ward Connerly, a businessman and black conservative who led the battle to end affirmative action in California, had turned his attentions to Florida, and Mr. Bush's One Florida plan was seen as a way to blunt that looming battle in a year that his brother was running for president. Critics of the plan, who fought against it when Mr. Bush unveiled it in November, said it is too soon to claim victory, and said the affirmative action program he ended was already steadily improving minority enrollment. Mr. Bush said the Florida plan does something old affirmative action did not do: It allows students to pursue an education without the stigma of set-asides and lowered admission standards. ''Every student entering our system today can be proud of what we accomplished, and be confident that achievement, not skin color or ethnic background, is the only measure of merit in our universities,'' he said. Of the 3,202 incoming students, 1,234 were minorities, and all 10 colleges in the state system increased their enrollment of blacks, according to statistics from the university system. That increase of black enrollment was not just at predominantly black colleges, but also at Florida's two leading state-run universities -- the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and Florida State University, in Tallahassee. The number of enrolling black students at the University of Florida was up 33 percent from last year, and up 21 percent from last year at Florida State. The number of Hispanic students enrolling at the University of Florida grew by 19 percent, and by 24 percent at Florida State. The two leading universities enrolled 577 more black and Hispanic students this year than last year. In the past, universities had put in place a double standard for minorities, and quotas.

Azoulay, 45, came from behind to defeat Hamad bin Abdulaziz Al-Kawari, also a former culture minister, after he failed to pick up support from other Gulf states which are part of a Saudi-led coalition blockading Qatar. The vote was 30 to 28. The campaign to succeed UNESCO's outgoing chief Irina Bokova was overshadowed by Washington's announcement Thursday that it planned to withdraw from the Paris-based body after years of tensions over decisions seen as critical of Israel. In the face of the Arab divisions, France presented Azoulay as a consensus figure who could mend fences and soothe tensions with Israel. \"In a time of crisis, we need more than ever to get involved (and) work to strengthen the organisation,\" Azoulay said after the final vote. Azoulay, who is Jewish of Moroccan origin, will face the difficult task of trying to persuade the United States and Israel to remain as members. Just as daunting will be her job of reforming the agency struggling under the weight of a bureaucracy that has become unwieldy over the seven decades since it was founded. French President Emmanuel Macron hailed her victory on Twitter, saying: \"France will continue to fight for science, education and culture in the world.\" Azoulay, who will become UNESCO's second woman leader after Bokova, had edged out Egyptian rights activist Moushira Khattab earlier Friday as the main challenger to Al-Kawari, the frontrunner until the final run-off. Azoulay's nomination must be approved by the agency's 195 member states on November 10, a vote that has never previously gone against the board's nominee. Arab states believed the job of director-general of the organisation should go to one of them for the first time, but regional rivalries and the US and Israeli withdrawals undercut their ambitions. Egypt threw its weight behind Azoulay after Khattab dropped out, a member of her delegation told AFP. Egypt is part of the coalition led by Saudi Arabia that has been blockading strategically placed Qatar since June over its alleged support for radical Islamists and its ties to Iran. Lebanon's candidate Vera El-Khoury, who bowed out at the fourth round of voting, told AFP that the power game at play in the race had shown UNESCO members \"did not give a damn\" about the candidates' programmes. Qatar has generously funded UNESCO in recent years and lobbied intensively for the post, which would have helped bolster its international status at a time when it faces isolation in the Gulf. Al-Kawari had also been dogged by old allegations of anti-Semitism after the Simon Wiesenthal Center accused him of remaining silent about anti-Semitic books at a fair in Doha when he was culture minister. UNESCO is best known for its World Heritage sites including tourist favourites such as the Grand Canyon or Cambodia's Angkor Wat, but it also carries out a wide range of projects in Africa, Latin America and the Pacific.

The California Fair Political Practices Commission released a report this week on its website detailing \u201can earmarked, over-the-limit contribution\u201d to Williams\u2019 campaign totaling $4,320 to pay for a radio advertisement supporting Williams. Individual contributions are limited to $3,900, which Nielsen made. The larger contribution was made through the Tehama County Republican Central Committee and was earmarked for Williams in violation of campaign finance law, the report said. In addition, Nielsen filed a campaign statement for the first half of 2012 \u201cerroneously reporting information regarding that contribution,\u201d the report said. For his part, Williams, Friends of Williams and Friends of Williams treasurer David Bauer violated rules when they accepted the over-the-limit contribution from Taxpayers for Nielsen and filed a campaign statement for May 20 through June 30, 2012, erroneously reporting information regarding that contribution. \u201cI\u2019m just happy that the matter\u2019s finally resolved,\u201d Williams said Tuesday. Williams said the controversy was politically motivated by his opponent in the race, Dan Logue. Logue went on to win the 3rd Assembly seat. Williams said he hired a professional treasurer to avoid any impropriety during the campaign and he was adamant that nobody involved with his campaign, including himself and Bauer, did anything wrong. The Tehama GOP and its treasurer Roger Marsh, acting as the intermediary of Taxpayers for Nielsen, failed to disclose both the intermediary and the original contributor information for the $4,320 contribution from Taxpayers for Nielsen to Friends of Williams, the report said. Tehama GOP, Marsh and Linda Alston, who took over as treasurer in February 2013, filed an original and an amended campaign statement erroneously reporting that Tehama GOP made a contribution to Friends of Williams, instead of disclosing that Tehama GOP was the intermediary for the aforementioned contribution.

Your skin begins to tingle as you approach the room as soon as the canisters are opened. As you step inside the back of your neck feels hot. The muffled yells of the instructor order you to remove your mask. The first deep breath without a gas mask creates an uncomfortable situation. Soldiers of Echo Company, 65th Brigade Engineer Battalion, 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, conducted Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear training (CBRN) on Feb. 5, here on Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. The training is done to prepare Soldiers for chemical attacks. Chlorobenzylidene malononitrile, commonly referred to as CS gas or tear gas is used to train Soldiers within the gas chamber. Soldiers began the morning by lining up outside of the chamber doing checks on their masks to ensure their equipment works properly. \"Having confidence in your equipment is what can ultimately determine mission success,\" said Command Sgt. Maj. Sean Horval, senior enlisted advisor of 2IBCT \"There is always a chance that with future conflicts, chemicals could be involved. It is always smart to prep for the worst. If or when something does happen,we are ready.\" After lining up, Soldiers are instructed to make sure their masks have a good seal. By ensuring the masks are properly sealed, the mask is able to do its job in regulating clean air through the user. Upon entering, Soldiers are ordered to break the seals on their mask, re-seal their masks and then fully remove their masks before exiting the chamber. \"My eyes were burning, they started watering,\" said Pvt. Jeremiah Cannon, a mechanic assigned to Echo Co. \"After taking our masks off, we were told to explain why we joined the Army as a test to see how long we could take the gas. I could barely get my answer out, my lungs were burning.\" The exit to the gas chamber suddenly opened and the Soldiers poured out as quickly as they could squeeze through the door. Instructors began yelling out \"Don't touch your eyes or your face!\" to prevent Soldiers from rubbing more of the irritating contaminant on their bodies. \"The training is great in that it allows Soldiers to build proficiency in the event of a nuclear, biological or chemical attack,\" said Lt. Col. William VanDerBurgh, battalion sergeant major for Echo Co. \"This type of training gives Soldiers the ability to react to these threats quickly.\" KGPE - Copyright  2017 KGPE.

But if pilots put them in a high-speed dive, they began to experience control problems that led to the deaths of several pilots.\nThe main problem facing these pilots was the aerodynamic condition known as compressibility. Simply stated, at speeds well below the speed of sound, most of the air molecules have time to get out of the way of an aircraft as it approaches, and the density of the air does not change.\nHowever, as the speed of sound is approached, the air molecules can\u2019t get out of the way, and more of them hit the aircraft. The impact compresses the air in front of the aircraft and increases the air density. Eventually shock waves form around the airplane, affecting the lift and drag. These changes were not well-understood and led to the loss of control in several aircraft.\nBecause the effects of compressibility are directly related to the speed of sound, a ratio is used to describe the speed of an aircraft. The Mach number is the speed at which an object is traveling relative to the speed of sound at a particular temperature. The name is in honor of physicist Ernest Mach, who studied high-speed gas dynamics.\nThe Bell X-1 was developed to research aerodynamics in the transonic region, or speeds just below and just above the speed of sound. After numerous flights with civilian test pilots, Capt. Yeager of the newly formed U.S. Air Force made his first powered flight in the X-1 on Aug. 29, 1947, high over the Mojave Desert of southern California.\nThe problem Yeager was experiencing was the ineffectiveness of the X-1\u2019s pitch controls, as shock waves essentially created an aerodynamic shadow around the tail. Changes were made to the horizontal tail controls, allowing Yeager to control the airplane's ability to pitch up and down, and flights continued. This knowledge would lead to the all-flying tail, or stabilator, standard on all supersonic fighters today.\nYeager was nursing two broken ribs on the morning of Oct. 14, after being thrown from his horse on a ride the night before. He boarded the B-29 bomber that was to carry the Bell X-1 to altitude. The plan was to fly to Mach 0.97. But Yeager says the new moving tail boosted his morale, and he wanted to fly faster.\nAfter climbing down into the X-1, which was carried like a bomb in the belly of the B-29, Yeager\u2019s friend and fellow test pilot Jack Ridley handed him a short, sawed-off section of broomstick. Yeager would use it to close the canopy of the X-1, because his broken ribs prevented him from closing the latch normally.\nPeople on the ground heard what sounded like distant thunder.

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton last week spelled out her renewable energy policy plans: Have more than half a billion solar panels installed throughout the nation in her first term and generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America. IBM has developed a computer system that can learn about weather from thousands of data points and predict days -- even weeks -- in advance how much power from solar and wind farms will be available for the U.S. power grid. Renewable energy, combined with prolific battery storage, will soon result in vastly cheaper electricity -- and solar power that's less expensive than what fossil fuel-based power plants can produce. I've written before about ways you can save money on pricey printer consumables. Could Tesla Energy's batteries blow up Elon Musk's company? Tesla CEO Elon Musk is no stranger to risky but successful ventures. He's helped found companies such as PayPal and other leading edge tech firms, including an aerospace manufacturer to help colonize Mars. A new report warns that if Tesla continues to grow at the current rate of $4.7 billion to $10.4 billion per quarter, its battery costs will rise and threaten the company's very existence.

Past attempts to get marijuana legislation through Congress haven\u2019t had much support from interest groups beyond those directly advocating for pot, like NORML and the Marijuana Policy Project. That isn\u2019t the case this year. According to a press release from Warren\u2019s office, the STATES Act is supported by the ACLU, the American Bankers Association, Americans for Prosperity (the Koch brothers funded political interest group), Americans for Tax Reform, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Cooperative Credit Union Association, the Credit Union National Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and a number of Indian tribes. The support from a diverse portfolio of interest groups, especially conservative ones, significantly increases the bill\u2019s chances of passage. Put not your trust in polls department.

The state is on the march. \u2018\u2018Today we\u2019re in a new planned economy,\u2019\u2019 a \u2018\u2018politically left, economically right\u2019\u2019 setup that does not guarantee individual protections and offers no sense of security, he said. Capitalism, several participants said, functions in China according to the unwritten rules created by the power holders, not by good laws, as Hayek urged. \u2018\u2018Communism has failed. Socialism has failed. What we have here is statism. And Hayek really opposed that. So how should we understand Hayek in the context of today\u2019s China?\u2019\u2019 asked Mr. Gao. In August, the association held its ninth annual meeting, in Tianjin, to consider that. Next year will mark its 10th anniversary, and members hope to meet overseas for the first time, in Taiwan or Hawaii. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve met in lots of places in China and thought we\u2019d meet overseas for a change,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Gao. The meeting did not advertise itself as a Hayek Association event, but topics included the core issues of economic and personal liberty. As always in China, there\u2019s more intellectual and social ferment, including in the ranks of the ruling Communist Party, than the outside world realizes. According to one participant, who but declined to be identified for fear of upsetting his family, it is common for professors and other \u2018\u2018institutional figures\u2019\u2019 to be questioned, forbidden to speak, and subjected to punishment for advocating ideas that are unpopular with the authorities. The problem is a general one, in which the state controls most of the economy and society. \u2018\u2018Our universities are a reflection of society,\u2019\u2019 said a law professor at a prestigious university. <sent> \u2018\u2018Professor Cao (Jianguo) is not a wild-eyed freedom fighter,\u2019\u2019 he said, referring to the education minister for communist party chiefs, as \u2018\u2018the boss.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018You have to keep him in check.

{"prefix": "My best friend in college was a straight-A student, an English major. In part he got all A\u2019s because he is whip smart\u2014his essays were systematically better than everyone else\u2019s. But the other reason was that he refused to enroll in a course unless he was certain he would ace it. Consequently, he never really challenged himself to try something beyond his comfort zone. I, on the other hand, was not a straight-A student. My first semester I took atomic physics with Professor Delroy Baugh, self-proclaimed \u201cLaser Guy.\u201d I\u2019d never taken a physics course before in my life, and as a reward for my willingness to transcend my comfort zone I received a D.\nSomewhere between the two of us lies a sweet spot: if you only ever get 100 percent on your tests, they aren\u2019t hard enough. If you never get above 50 percent, you\u2019re probably in the wrong major. The trick is to be right enough, but not so right that you never allow yourself the opportunity to be wrong.\nSo, how wrong should you be?\nWilson and his colleagues derive the number from experiments in machine learning. Under loose assumptions, they show that the optimal error rate for training a broad class of deep learning algorithms is 15 percent. The fastest learning progress occurs when the error rate hits this sweet spot. They show that this number is also in line with previous work on learning in humans and animals.\nThe implications of the 85 percent rule in the classroom are straightforward. If you\u2019re a teacher, your tests should be difficult enough that the average score is 85 percent. If you\u2019re a student, the optimal level of challenge is about a B or a B+ average. An A might look nice on your transcript, but you could have stood to learn more from a class that was harder. Outside the classroom, the implications of the 85 percent rule are similar. If you are learning a new language, say on Duolingo, then you should be getting about 15 percent of the answers wrong. Otherwise, you\u2019re not being challenged at the right level to consistently improve in picking up your new language.\nBut the 85 percent rule only holds for one class of problems, where the point is to build up expertise over many trials. With other kinds of problems you really don\u2019t want to get them wrong at all. For example, should you believe in God? Pascal wagered that you should, because if you don\u2019t there\u2019ll be hell to pay. Most people make up their minds one way about this issue and tend not to change their position too frequently. This presents a paradox: suppose 50 percent of people believe in God and 50 percent don\u2019t. Half are on the side opposite the truth. Yet no matter what evidence you present them with they won\u2019t admit they\u2019re wrong. In this case we see an error rate of zero. Why is no one ever wrong about their belief in God?\nHere another answer comes from cognitive science, in a paper by Samuel Gershman of Harvard University titled \u201cHow to Never Be Wrong.\u201d In the paper Gershman considers the problem of auxiliary hypotheses. The idea is that any given theory comes with a set of undisclosed assumptions, which can protect the core theory from being disproved. For example, the seven-day creation story of Genesis is at odds with the fossil record. So if you accept the fossil record, do you have to forfeit Genesis?\nNope. All you have to do is note that a \u201cday\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be 24 hours\u2014especially not if God hasn\u2019t created", "gen_completion": " a day at all yet, which Gershman allows. If God works in mysterious ways, does it make sense for God to have to hide His mistakes? Here again you might argue that the fossils don\u2019t disprove the creation story, because they provide evidence that the universe came into being. But the fossils also don\u2019t prove that the universe came into being through no design, no intervention, etc. If they did prove this, what makes up their value?\nYou can use any number of auxiliary hypotheses, that is, any non-core assumptions, to try and prove a theory, which is also an inference. If you accept scientific explanation for all of the apparent randomness of the universe, then we have to assume that the Universe is random, which would then exclude any belief in an invisible hand that guides creation.

In part he got all A\u2019s because he is whip smart\u2014his essays were systematically better than everyone else\u2019s. But the other reason was that he refused to enroll in a course unless he was certain he would ace it. Consequently, he never really challenged himself to try something beyond his comfort zone. I, on the other hand, was not a straight-A student. My first semester I took atomic physics with Professor Delroy Baugh, self-proclaimed \u201cLaser Guy.\u201d I\u2019d never taken a physics course before in my life, and as a reward for my willingness to transcend my comfort zone I received a D. Somewhere between the two of us lies a sweet spot: if you only ever get 100 percent on your tests, they aren\u2019t hard enough. If you never get above 50 percent, you\u2019re probably in the wrong major. The trick is to be right enough, but not so right that you never allow yourself the opportunity to be wrong. So, how wrong should you be? Wilson and his colleagues derive the number from experiments in machine learning. Under loose assumptions, they show that the optimal error rate for training a broad class of deep learning algorithms is 15 percent. The fastest learning progress occurs when the error rate hits this sweet spot. They show that this number is also in line with previous work on learning in humans and animals. The implications of the 85 percent rule in the classroom are straightforward. If you\u2019re a teacher, your tests should be difficult enough that the average score is 85 percent. If you\u2019re a student, the optimal level of challenge is about a B or a B+ average. An A might look nice on your transcript, but you could have stood to learn more from a class that was harder. Outside the classroom, the implications of the 85 percent rule are similar. If you are learning a new language, say on Duolingo, then you should be getting about 15 percent of the answers wrong. Otherwise, you\u2019re not being challenged at the right level to consistently improve in picking up your new language. But the 85 percent rule only holds for one class of problems, where the point is to build up expertise over many trials. With other kinds of problems you really don\u2019t want to get them wrong at all. For example, should you believe in God? Pascal wagered that you should, because if you don\u2019t there\u2019ll be hell to pay. Most people make up their minds one way about this issue and tend not to change their position too frequently. This presents a paradox: suppose 50 percent of people believe in God and 50 percent don\u2019t. Half are on the side opposite the truth. Yet no matter what evidence you present them with they won\u2019t admit they\u2019re wrong. In this case we see an error rate of zero. Why is no one ever wrong about their belief in God? Here another answer comes from cognitive science, in a paper by Samuel Gershman of Harvard University titled \u201cHow to Never Be Wrong.\u201d In the paper Gershman considers the problem of auxiliary hypotheses. The idea is that any given theory comes with a set of undisclosed assumptions, which can protect the core theory from being disproved. For example, the seven-day creation story of Genesis is at odds with the fossil record. So if you accept the fossil record, do you have to forfeit Genesis? Nope. All you have to do is note that a \u201cday\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be 24 hours\u2014especially not if God hasn\u2019t created a day yet, which Gershman allows. Similarly, you could argue that the fossil record doesn\u2019t disprove the creation story, because it merely shows that the universe came into being at some point. If God is working in mysterious ways, why would He need to hide His mistakes? The existence of fossils doesn\u2019t prove that the universe didn\u2019t come into being through some form of design, intervention, etc., so what good would it do to show that it didn\u2019t? And you could do the same with any number of other auxiliary hypotheses\u2014that is, non-core assumptions\u2014to try to prove your theory, which is itself also an inference. If you accept the scientific explanation for the apparently random and chaotic features of the universe, you have to assume that the universe is random, which would rule out belief in some hidden hand behind the creation. That\u2019s just a silly straw man. Any given theory comes with a set of auxiliary hypotheses. <sent> The value of the </sent>", "output": ["a day yet, which Gershman allows.

But caring for the life created by unwed Irish parents in most of the 20th century was manifestly not an urgent priority for many members of the religious orders entrusted with their care. Donohue then blasted historian Catherine Corless, whom, he said, had claimed 800 babies were buried in a tank outside the former Mother and Baby home. That\u2019s wholly inaccurate, however, Corless made no such claim. Instead, she unearthed the death certificates for 798 infants and children at the Galway\u2019s records office and simply asked where they had been buried, since there was no official or religious monument to their life and death of any kind in the town? So Donohue\u2019s argument really comes down to semantics. Is a \u201cmass grave,\u201d which Corless never spoke of, proven or not proven by the discovery of \u201csignificant quantities of human remains\u201d at the former Mother and Baby Home site? He thinks not. He\u2019s alone in that view. Instead of asking why the police and the local authorities \u2013 including the council and church \u2013 took no action at all on learning of the discovery (Sweeney and Hopkins were allegedly found playing with human skulls) Donohue informs us that at most the two children found between 15 and 20 small skeletons. 15 to 20 small skeletons in an unmarked hole. Nothing to see there, eh Bill? But, in fact, the Ryan and McAleese reports concern themselves with lay inmates and the two reports document that sexual abuse was \u201cendemic\u201d at these institutions, in particular at Magdalene Laundries, with the McAleese Report detailing widespread detention, forced labor and dehumanizing treatment. Given the scale of the official findings, it is hard to imagine how Donohue\u2019s \u201cit\u2019s all a lie\u201d claims can do a lot of good in the public eye. His letter comes barely two years after the Catholic League was tasked with examining hundreds of thousands of documents provided by the commission\u2019s investigators in 2015. \u201cWe will not lend any credence whatsoever to any reports alleging the existence of any burial site of human remains at the former Mother and Baby Home in Tuam,\u201d it said then and it continues to hold that view. If it \u201cidentified\u201d human remains, it said, it \u201chas nothing to say on the matter.\u201d That is the wording of a letter sent by Bill Donohue, the head of the Catholic League, to its members in New York, in which he accuses Corless and the commission of promoting \u201cthe tale of a mass grave\u201d to gain attention for the commission\u2019s recommendation that the archdiocese pay compensation to those allegedly abused as children at the former Mother and Baby home. <sent> And, of course, </sent>", "output": ["a lot of good in the public eye.

Beer Week, real estate observers are marveling over the market changes that have seen the return of the first production breweries to the District since the Christian Heurich Brewing Co. shut down its Foggy Bottom brewing operations in 1956.\nBack when D.C. Beer Week first started in 2008, there were no production breweries in the District proper. Now there are three, and two more breweries are planning to open. The growing popularity of craft beer in the region dates back to 1992 when Capitol City Brewing Co. became the first \u201cbrewpub\u201d to open in the city since Prohibition. Since then, numerous brewpubs have opened throughout the region. The chief distinction between these establishments and breweries is that brewpubs primarily brew beer for sale on site in their restaurant and bar locations, and as such they generally occupy retail/restaurant spaces.\nProduction breweries, on the other hand, primarily produce beer sold off-site in local bars, restaurants and other outlets.

As brew lovers celebrated the growing popularity of craft beer during last week\u2019s fifth annual D.C. Beer Week, real estate observers are marveling over the market changes that have seen the return of the first production breweries to the District since the Christian Heurich Brewing Co. shut down its Foggy Bottom brewing operations in 1956. Back when D.C. Beer Week first started in 2008, there were no production breweries in the District proper. Now there are three, and two more breweries are planning to open. The growing popularity of craft beer in the region dates back to 1992 when Capitol City Brewing Co. became the first \u201cbrewpub\u201d to open in the city since Prohibition. Since then, numerous brewpubs have opened throughout the region. The chief distinction between these establishments and breweries is that brewpubs primarily brew beer for sale on site in their restaurant and bar locations, and as such they generally occupy retail/restaurant spaces. Production breweries, on the other hand, primarily produce beer sold off-site in local bars, restaurants and other outlets.

He said Jewish experts had not yet decided on further actions regarding the human bones discovered on the first day of digging.\nTesting was halted after the first bone fragments were found.

Some, including Baubonis, also said that the archaeologists could have simply dropped their equipment when the first bones were found, because they did not stop working right after that.\nThe Archeological Society argues that the ground near the site is also being developed and their findings do not affect development, as the area on which the remains were located is owned by the state.

The Lithuanian Archeological Society said in a letter that \"the discovered fragments of human bones makes it impossible to determine religious, cultural or ethnic dependence of the dead people,\" and that \"the unearthed layer with the findings may have formed from surrounding soil or may have been brought from other locations as construction ruins.\" The senior state inspector of the Cultural Heritage Department, Renaldas Augustinavicius, reported that the archeological tests would be resumed in September. He said Jewish experts had not yet decided on further actions regarding the human bones discovered on the first day of digging. Testing was halted after the first bone fragments were found. Having found fragments of human and animal bones, the Lithuanian archeologists could no longer continue their activities due to objections by the monitors. Chaim Birshtein, a Jewish Community leader in Lithuania agrees with the stopping of surveying. \"Jewish or not, all people's bones should be preserved,\" he told The Baltic Times. \"By finding the bones, it is proven that this is a cemetery. Whatever has been damaged has been damaged and we just want the bones to lie there in peace now,\" Birshtein added. He is, however, outspoken about possible conspiracies against the community, saying, \"They don't want to show the truth to everybody.\" News of the halted tests was announced by the Cultural Heritage Department, which said that \"fragments of household ceramics and shattered glass, parts of metal items, single human and animal bones not in anatomical positions,\" were found some 20 to 30 centimeters under the surface. Specialists have so far refused to specify whether the discovered remains were Jewish, saying certain tests would still be carried out because the remains were \"not in anatomical positions,\" According to The Baltic Times, if the bones were human, the only possibility of identifying them was through a chemical analysis, while if they were animal, it would be possible to identify the species and the place of origin. Some of those who have opposed the project have accused the archeologists of wishing to give the impression that they have discovered an old Jewish cemetery in order to delay the granting of planning permission - it was only recently that the issue was resolved in parliament. Some, including Baubonis, have also suggested that archeologists simply threw away their tools when the first bones were discovered, and that they should not have stopped work when they did.

{"prefix": "Some of the most amazing coffees I've ever tasted have been winners from the Cup of Excellence competition. The program has been referred to as the Oscars of coffee and seeks to identify the best beans from many of the top coffee farms in the world. An international jury of professional coffee tasters is invited to the host country to cup the selected entries. Cup of Excellence competitions have been held in Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Rwanda, Costa Rica and Colombia.\nOn the first day of the competition there is an extensive calibration. During the next two days, the international jury cups the coffees that have been approved and passed by the national jury. On the fourth day, the jury cups about 45 coffees which have passed the first round. Coffees scoring an 84 or above during this round are awarded the prestigious Cup of Excellence.\nThe top ten scoring coffees are ranked again to discover the first place winner of the competition. Winning Cup of Excellence coffees are then sold through an internet auction. The most recent auction was held on January 18th, for the winning farms of the 2010 Brazilian competition. I was thrilled to see two of my friends receive the top two awards. Cl\u00e1udio Carneiro Pinto's Grota S\u00e3o Pedro farm was awarded first place. His coffee sold for $25.05 per pound. Carlos Segio Sanglard's Serra do Bone took second place. His coffee fetched $12.10 per pound. Of the thirty-one winners, these were the only organic lots.\nIn November, I had the extremely desirable assignment of traveling to Machado, Brazil and serving as a member of the international jury. Over the course of a week, we slurped, scrutinized, evaluated, and ranked the top forty-seven selections from the 2010 Brazil coffee harvest. This was my 9th Cup of Excellence jury invitation and 6th appearance as a member of the Brazil panel. The coffees were phenomenally clean, sweet, aromatic and delicious!\n\"While I was a consultant outside of the roasting/retail business, I became involved with a United Nations project that was trying to develop higher quality coffees in order to sell at higher premiums. So when specialty coffee was really growing (1990's), and there were many success stories, farmers were not feeling the benefit of that at all. That's when I co-founded the Cup of Excellence, which was an international competition where we brought in roasters from Japan, Europe, The Americas and around the world to taste coffees. That suddenly really raised the price and also brought attention and identity to single farmers for the first time, so within two to three years, entire regions -- not only farmers, but regions -- were being discovered. Brazil had always been discounted as being poor producers of quality. Suddenly they became desirable, their prices went up. Individual farms were able to make connections to roasters and roasters to farmers. So now you had Europeans, Japanese and Americans coming to Brazil to visit those farms and buy at higher premiums.\"\nI recently interviewed Cup of Excellence's other co-founder, Susie Spindler and asked her how she sees CoE as improving coffee quality. Here was her response.\n[\"The] Cup of Excellence program has improved quality by giving farmers a financial incentive to do the best job they can. The hope of winning a Cup of Excellence supports the focus on quality above all else at the individual farm.

This has created a much better understanding of the importance of the long term financial value of the long term benefit that you receive from producing high quality coffee.

The program has been referred to as the Oscars of coffee and seeks to identify the best beans from many of the top coffee farms in the world. An international jury of professional coffee tasters is invited to the host country to cup the selected entries. Cup of Excellence competitions have been held in Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Rwanda, Costa Rica and Colombia. On the first day of the competition there is an extensive calibration. During the next two days, the international jury cups the coffees that have been approved and passed by the national jury. On the fourth day, the jury cups about 45 coffees which have passed the first round. Coffees scoring an 84 or above during this round are awarded the prestigious Cup of Excellence. The top ten scoring coffees are ranked again to discover the first place winner of the competition. Winning Cup of Excellence coffees are then sold through an internet auction. The most recent auction was held on January 18th, for the winning farms of the 2010 Brazilian competition. I was thrilled to see two of my friends receive the top two awards. Cl\u00e1udio Carneiro Pinto's Grota S\u00e3o Pedro farm was awarded first place. His coffee sold for $25.05 per pound. Carlos Segio Sanglard's Serra do Bone took second place. His coffee fetched $12.10 per pound. Of the thirty-one winners, these were the only organic lots. In November, I had the extremely desirable assignment of traveling to Machado, Brazil and serving as a member of the international jury. Over the course of a week, we slurped, scrutinized, evaluated, and ranked the top forty-seven selections from the 2010 Brazil coffee harvest. This was my 9th Cup of Excellence jury invitation and 6th appearance as a member of the Brazil panel. The coffees were phenomenally clean, sweet, aromatic and delicious! \"While I was a consultant outside of the roasting/retail business, I became involved with a United Nations project that was trying to develop higher quality coffees in order to sell at higher premiums. So when specialty coffee was really growing (1990's), and there were many success stories, farmers were not feeling the benefit of that at all. That's when I co-founded the Cup of Excellence, which was an international competition where we brought in roasters from Japan, Europe, The Americas and around the world to taste coffees. That suddenly really raised the price and also brought attention and identity to single farmers for the first time, so within two to three years, entire regions -- not only farmers, but regions -- were being discovered. Brazil had always been discounted as being poor producers of quality. Suddenly they became desirable, their prices went up. Individual farms were able to make connections to roasters and roasters to farmers. So now you had Europeans, Japanese and Americans coming to Brazil to visit those farms and buy at higher premiums.\" I recently interviewed Cup of Excellence's other co-founder, Susie Spindler and asked her how she sees CoE as improving coffee quality. Here was her response. [\"The] Cup of Excellence program has improved quality by giving farmers a financial incentive to do the best job they can. The hope of winning a Cup of Excellence supports the focus on quality above all else at the individual farm. This means that hundreds of farmers every year try to improve their quality and even if there are a few who are not successful every year, the competition sends a message to consumers that quality is important. As a result of the higher premiums, farmers have also been able to pay farmers for the use of their land. Over the past 12 to 14 years, our coffees have gotten about $2.50 to $3 per pound more. And the farmers are better able to make the decision to produce higher quality coffees, which means they have more to sell to roasters in the U.S.\" <sent> This results in a higher quality coffee marketplace.\" One of the most amazing things I experienced at the 2010 Brazilian competition were the hundreds of farmers who traveled to Machado de Avrai to meet and interact.

But, as often seen in the game, such tools are for naught if not accompanied with a sound mental game. At the moment, one that Day doesn't seem to harbor. For nearly two years, speculation has surrounded the professional prospects of Maverick McNealy. The Stanford product, who's reached No. 1 in the amateur rankings, has toyed with keeping his am status and becoming a modern-day Bobby Jones. McNealy's not short on capital -- his father, Scott, is founder of Sun Microsystems -- affording the leeway for such a scenario. However, speaking with Golf Channel's Harig over the weekend, he acknowledged the difficulties of finding his game and how that's slowed his progress. \u201cYou're going through a stretch where you're just going through the motions and it gets a little boring,\u201d he said. \u201cIn college, I always wanted to shoot under par every single tournament I played, and I just couldn't do that to start the year. <sent> \u2026 At practice it just wasn't clicking for me.

He is a smart, gentle spirit with a kind heart. I would be eager to hire him at Church Health, but it is not that easy.\nHe grew up in Aleppo, Syria, where he fell in love with wanting to help people through medicine.\nIn 2011, he had completed four years of his six-year medical training program (that is the way it is done in British-influenced countries) when things began to fall apart in Syria. Inspired by the pro-democracy movement, a group of school boys in Syria began writing anti-government slogans on walls.\nThe government reacted by rounding up the boys and torturing them. Protests broke out. The Syrian civil war had begun.\nThrough the early days of the war, Rami kept going to school. Then one day, for who knows what reason, he was arrested and placed in solitary confinement in a dark basement. His family had no idea what had happened to him or where he was. He was just gone.\nHis cell was too small to lie down. He was fed once a day. He could hear other prisoners being tortured. After three months, he had lost 60 pounds. He was then asked, \u201cAre you sorry for what you did?\u201d He hadn\u2019t done anything, but he said, \u201cI am sorry.\u201d And just like that he was let go.\nHis parents knew they had to leave Syria. They escaped through Lebanon and came to where they had family in Memphis.\nRami arrived in Memphis in 2012. He did not speak a word of English, so he took ESL classes at the University of Memphis and spent a year learning English. His desire to be a doctor had not waned.\nBecause Rami had never graduated from college in a U.S. system, attending an American medical school was not an option. So he applied to a school in the Caribbean. He effectively had to start over, but he was determined, and he did very well.\nI met him through his cousin who cooks wonderful Syrian food at the Global Caf\u00e9 at Crosstown Concourse. I was shocked when I learned that this truly remarkable young doctor was stymied in moving on in his training to become a resident physician because of his circuitous path through medical school. His credentials do not match up the \u201cproper way,\u201d so training programs, including the one based at Church Health, are prohibited from offering him a position.\nIn Rami\u2019s case, I cannot even blame the bank. It would be a true tragedy except for his remarkable spirit. He doesn\u2019t blame anyone, not even his captors in Syria.

I want to hire him. But senseless paperwork has our plans on hold. Rami Sakaan just wants to be a doctor. He is a smart, gentle spirit with a kind heart. I would be eager to hire him at Church Health, but it is not that easy. He grew up in Aleppo, Syria, where he fell in love with wanting to help people through medicine. In 2011, he had completed four years of his six-year medical training program (that is the way it is done in British-influenced countries) when things began to fall apart in Syria. Inspired by the pro-democracy movement, a group of school boys in Syria began writing anti-government slogans on walls. The government reacted by rounding up the boys and torturing them. Protests broke out. The Syrian civil war had begun. Through the early days of the war, Rami kept going to school. Then one day, for who knows what reason, he was arrested and placed in solitary confinement in a dark basement. His family had no idea what had happened to him or where he was. He was just gone. His cell was too small to lie down. He was fed once a day. He could hear other prisoners being tortured. After three months, he had lost 60 pounds. He was then asked, \u201cAre you sorry for what you did?\u201d He hadn\u2019t done anything, but he said, \u201cI am sorry.\u201d And just like that he was let go. His parents knew they had to leave Syria. They escaped through Lebanon and came to where they had family in Memphis. Rami arrived in Memphis in 2012. He did not speak a word of English, so he took ESL classes at the University of Memphis and spent a year learning English. His desire to be a doctor had not waned. Because Rami had never graduated from college in a U.S. system, attending an American medical school was not an option. So he applied to a school in the Caribbean. He effectively had to start over, but he was determined, and he did very well. I met him through his cousin who cooks wonderful Syrian food at the Global Caf\u00e9 at Crosstown Concourse. I was shocked when I learned that this truly remarkable young doctor was stymied in moving on in his training to become a resident physician because of his circuitous path through medical school. His credentials do not match up the \u201cproper way,\u201d so training programs, including the one based at Church Health, are prohibited from offering him a position. In Rami\u2019s case, I cannot even blame the bank. It would be a true tragedy except for his remarkable spirit. He doesn\u2019t blame anyone, not even his captors in Syria. He is just determined to be a doctor who will serve those who are un-served, either in Memphis or back in Syria. There is some good news. A small hospital in the middle of Mississippi has found a way around the paperwork obstacles. If I am right, come March 15, there will be a way forward for Rami and his dream to become a physician.

He was in fair condition Friday, said Hilary Andrade, a hospital spokeswoman. A witness told police the two men fought before the incident, but officers were unable to talk with the victim because of his condition, Beckley said. Blanco-Martinez made his first appearance in Whatcom County Superior Court on Friday afternoon before Commissioner David Thorne. He has lived in Whatcom County since 1989, said Angela Anderson, Blanco-Martinez\u2019s public defender. Erik Sigmar, the deputy prosecutor, told the court Blanco-Martinez admitted to being in a fight when police arrested him. He also had injuries to his face, Sigmar said, reading from charging papers. Blanco-Martinez has proven himself a flight risk eight times in the past, Sigmar said, urging Thorne to set bail at $100,000. Thorne followed the recommendation. Blanco-Martinez was sentenced in another assault case involving a weapon in August 2009, according to court records. In that case, he had been driving south on Interstate 5 in a black GMC Yukon. Leonardo Blanco-Martinez, whose relationship to Victor is not clear in court papers, was in the passenger seat. As Victor Blanco-Martinez was driving, Leonardo, leaning out of the passenger-side window, used an aluminum bat to break the driver-side windows of a van driving in an adjacent lane with two people inside, records say. The woman driving the van tried speeding away, and eventually got off the freeway at the State Street exit as the men kept driving south. She called police from the parking lot of a nearby Subway. A witness driving in another car also stopped to give details to a state patrol trooper, according to court papers. A Bellingham police officer found the Yukon driving near Samish Way and 36th Street and followed it until it stopped at a house along the 500 block of 38th Street, according to charging papers. Both men got out of the car, and a man who had stepped out of the front door of the home told the officer he did not know the men. The officer yelled at both the men to get back into the car. They ran, then fell to the ground, with both men trying to hide the weapons in the yard, according to court papers. The officer caught up to the men and both were arrested. Prosecutors said Blanco-Martinez, then 29, of Bellingham, was driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Leonardo told officers he was drinking with his nephew and they had been arguing for several weeks. He also said he and his nephew had been in a fight at the home of Victor\u2019s father.

The request is the latest development in a lawsuit against the hospital because it and its parent agency are not promptly determining whether hundreds of pre-trial detainees lingering in county jails are competent to have their day in court. The request was made Thursday in Denver to Magistrate Judge Nina Y. Wang of the U.S. District Court for Colorado. It was made by Disability Law Colorado, an office that advocates for disabled persons in Colorado, including the detainees who are in jails all over the state. They are there because judges think they may not be competent. State mental health staff have to tell judges whether those defendants are competent. Until that happens, judges can't move the cases forward for juries to determine if the defendants are guilty. The current lawsuit \u2014 which has been ongoing since 2011 \u2014 was filed by Disability Law Colorado. It claims that the hospital and its parent agency are violating the constitutional rights of the detainees by allowing them to remain in jail, rather than quickly determining if they are competent to be put on trial. The defendants being detained are charged with a wide variety of crimes, ranging from low-level ones all the way to murder. Meanwhile Wang has given the hospital and its parent agency until Dec. 14 to submit to her a plan to remedy their failures to meet a required timeframe to conduct competency evaluations.. The hospital is the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo and its parent agency is the state Department of Human Services, headquartered in Denver. They have not yet replied in court to Thursday's request for the judge to appoint an forensics systems psychologist expert to serve Wang as a \"special master.\" That person would assist the judge with getting CMHIP and DHS into compliance with a requirement to provide the evaluations within 28 days of judges' orders for the evaluations. Judges of state courts across Colorado have for many years ordered DHS to conduct the evaluations so the judges can rule whether particular defendants are not competent to stand trial due to mental illness. They are presumed innocent under the law while they are awaiting trial. In Thursday's request, Disability Law Colorado said the most recent data shows \"the average wait time was at least 58.6 days and the longest wait time was 186 days.\" Wang has scheduled a multi-day hearing to begin March 18 in her Denver courtroom to hear arguments regarding what she should do to remedy the delays.

Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari addressed India in an opinion piece in The New York Times. In a sometimes deeply personal opinion piece in The New York Times, President Asif Ali Zardari wrote that his government, which took office earlier this year, was also the target of Islamic extremists -- \"and we continue to be their victims.\" But Sunday's raid on a camp used by the group India blames for the Mumbai attacks shows Pakistan is willing to crack down on \"non-state actors\" operating on its territory, he wrote. \"We understand the domestic political considerations in India in the aftermath of Mumbai,\" he wrote. \"Nevertheless, accusations of complicity on Pakistan's part only complicate the already complex situation.\" Pakistani security forces raided a camp near Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, on Sunday and arrested 15 people, a Pakistani security official told CNN. \"As was demonstrated in Sunday's raids, which resulted in the arrest of militants, Pakistan will take action against the non-state actors found within our territory, treating them as criminals, terrorists and murderers,\" Zardari wrote. \"Not only are the terrorists not linked to the government of Pakistan in any way, we are their targets and we continue to be their victims.\" Zardari's wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was killed in December 2007 in the second of two attempts on her life after she returned from exile that October. The president invoked her death to express sympathy for India's victims, writing, \"I feel this pain every time I look into the eyes of my children.\" \"The Mumbai attacks were directed not only at India, but also at Pakistan's new democratic government and the peace process with India that we have initiated,\" he wrote. \"Supporters of authoritarianism in Pakistan and non-state actors with a vested interest in perpetuating conflict do not want change in Pakistan to take root.\" Zardari wrote that militants in his country have been strengthened by the United States and its allies which empowered \"the most fanatic extremists\" to fight Soviet forces in Afghanistan during the Cold War. The Pakistani president never mentioned his country's past support of LeT, which Pakistan's intelligence agency, the ISI, helped create to fight against Indian rule in Kashmir in the 1990s. LeT has denied any role in the Mumbai attacks, and Pakistan has rejected accusations that the government supports terrorist groups. Under pressure from the U.S., Pakistan banned LeT after a 2001 attack on the Indian parliament that brought the nuclear-armed rivals to the brink of war. Citing American intelligence and counterterrorism Indian officials say the 11 commandos and their mastermind who went on the November 26 attacks in the commercial capital were members of LeT.

{"prefix": "Lo-Fi (Low Fidelity) is at present incorrectly assumed to be a genre of music. During its inception lo-fi was more akin to a type of sound rather than a style of music. However, over the years, lo-fi has somewhat become a standard genre of music that is known to be popular amongst \u201cbedroom musicians\u201d or people producing music from their homes as opposed to studios.\nLo-fi was heavily criticised by both critics and the general audience when it first came onto the scene. The so-called \u201clo-fi aesthetic\u201d would arise unintentionally during sound engineering and was characterised as being undesirable. Some of the first musicians to experiment with lo-fi did so somewhat by accident. The likes of Paul McCartney, The Beach Boys, Beck, and Robert Stevie Moore were among the first. Moore is today regarded as one of the pioneers of the genre.\nOut of all the artists associated with lo-fi back then, only Moore was producing music in his home, which ultimately resulted in the overall aesthetic. While Moore's name isn't known as widely, his work has influenced Beck, Guided by Voices, and Ariel Pink.\nBy the start of the 1990s, lo-fi would become a radio mainstay by finding a place in the grunge scene. Grunge musicians wanted their music to sound rough and low effort. The \u201caesthetic\u201d would prove to be as important in the grunge scene as the music itself.\nMoving forward, lo-fi found itself a new home in jazz rap, a genre filled with producers sampling classic jazz artists. Selectively sampling parts from 50s jazz and then looping it endlessly became a common industry practice in jazz rap.\nSo, where is lo-fi now? It's still here and has finally become a genre in its own right. Developments in technology over the past two decades has given rise to more bedroom musicians and created the electronic musician. The rise of personal computers and modern production capabilities has allowed more and more people to start dabbling in the genre by producing tracks from multiple samples.\nBut how did lo-fi finally make it into the mainstream? As music continued to evolve, demand arose at the turn of the last century for a different kind of music.\nThe purpose of a lo-fi track in this day and age is to be a simple song that you don't need to think about while you're listening to it. It's just the same sample (usually the best part) played on repeat over a beat with some effects such as that of a cassette deck or vinyl scratches added into the mix.", "gen_completion": " Essentially it's a good time. The phrase \u201csleazy\u201d is used to describe this particular brand of music. That's the whole point.\nSo just what is it?\nLo-fi is synonymous with \u201clow quality\u201d and \u201cno care\u201d. If it sounds cheap, then that's because it is, whether it's a studio track on a record or a lo-fi track you hear on TV for ten seconds. If it sounds fuzzy, that means the recording was done later in the process rather than when producing in your basement.\nIt is also known to be very minimal, which has nothing to do with its creation. Just like an LP record, which is a physical medium recorded on paper, records are not as clean and polished as CDs and vinyls.\nAs technology continues to improve, lo-fi music will no doubt improve.

However, over the years, lo-fi has somewhat become a standard genre of music that is known to be popular amongst \u201cbedroom musicians\u201d or people producing music from their homes as opposed to studios. Lo-fi was heavily criticised by both critics and the general audience when it first came onto the scene. The so-called \u201clo-fi aesthetic\u201d would arise unintentionally during sound engineering and was characterised as being undesirable. Some of the first musicians to experiment with lo-fi did so somewhat by accident. The likes of Paul McCartney, The Beach Boys, Beck, and Robert Stevie Moore were among the first. Moore is today regarded as one of the pioneers of the genre. Out of all the artists associated with lo-fi back then, only Moore was producing music in his home, which ultimately resulted in the overall aesthetic. While Moore's name isn't known as widely, his work has influenced Beck, Guided by Voices, and Ariel Pink. By the start of the 1990s, lo-fi would become a radio mainstay by finding a place in the grunge scene. Grunge musicians wanted their music to sound rough and low effort. The \u201caesthetic\u201d would prove to be as important in the grunge scene as the music itself. Moving forward, lo-fi found itself a new home in jazz rap, a genre filled with producers sampling classic jazz artists. Selectively sampling parts from 50s jazz and then looping it endlessly became a common industry practice in jazz rap. So, where is lo-fi now? It's still here and has finally become a genre in its own right. Developments in technology over the past two decades has given rise to more bedroom musicians and created the electronic musician. The rise of personal computers and modern production capabilities has allowed more and more people to start dabbling in the genre by producing tracks from multiple samples. But how did lo-fi finally make it into the mainstream? As music continued to evolve, demand arose at the turn of the last century for a different kind of music. The purpose of a lo-fi track in this day and age is to be a simple song that you don't need to think about while you're listening to it. It's just the same sample (usually the best part) played on repeat over a beat with some effects such as that of a cassette deck or vinyl scratches added into the mix. The end result is a track that's fun. This style of music is known as \u201cshitwave\u201d and that's exactly the point. And what is lo-fi? It's \u201clow quality\u201d and \u201clow effort\u201d. If it sounds bad that's because it is, be it a professional track on a record or a lo-fi track you've only heard for ten seconds on a music program. It's also a genre known for being extremely simple, which again has nothing to do with how it was created. In fact, lo-fi sounds like an LP record, an analog medium that records directly to a piece of paper and isn't as refined as CDs and digital music. <sent> As technology continues to improve, lo-fi music will no doubt improve.

As finance minister in P.V. Narasimha Rao's cabinet between 1991 and 1996, he not only put India on the map of the world's attractive investment destinations but also brought about a fundamental change in the way India Inc. conducted its business. \"He took path-breaking decisions at a time when our economy was in a terrible state,\" said N. Srinivasan, director general- designate of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). \"He is a man of great humility and total integrity who understands the economy extremely well,\" Srinivasan told IANS. But Rao was not the first prime minister who saw potential in this soft-spoken economist. In 1990, he was handpicked by then prime minister Chandra Shekhar as his economic advisor, thereby bringing him into the public eye for the first time. The other high points of his long career were governor of the Reserve Bank of India, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission and secretary general and commissioner of the South Commission in Geneva.

Born to Gurmukh Singh and Amrit Kaur on Sep 26, 1932, at Gah in West Punjab, now a part of Pakistan, Manmohan Singh studied economics at the University of Punjab, Oxford and Cambridge. Armed with a doctorate in economics, he began his career as a lecturer at the University of Punjab in 1957 and shifted to the Delhi School of Economics (D-School) in 1969. After three years in D-School, where he taught international trade, he became a civil servant -- first as an economic advisor in the ministry of foreign trade and then as chief economic advisor in the finance ministry. Between 1976 and 1980, he was also India's finance secretary, following which he was appointed member-secretary in the Planning Commission. From 1982 to 1985, he was governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and from 1985 to 1987 he was deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, which has traditionally been a position reserved for a politician with economic leanings. Between 1987 and 1991, he also served in various capacities at the South Commission, the Prime Minister's Office and the University Grants Commission. Having occupied virtually all key positions in India's economic administration, with added international perspective thanks to his stints at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and South-South Commission, it was time for Manmohan Singh to transform himself into a politician. In 1991, when he joined the Narasimha Rao cabinet, it was a turbulent time for the Indian economy with foreign exchange coffers barely enough for two weeks' imports. He nursed the economy and initiated policies that changed the basic aspirations of corporate India to become a global player and integrate with the world economy. \"I stood behind him like a rock,\" Naras Rao has said of Singh. \"Manmohan Singh has a lot to learn about managing the economy.

He blames Sessions for starting a chain of events that resulted in the appointment of the special prosecutor. TRUMP: Look, [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions gets the job. Right after he gets the job, he recuses himself. Trump dismisses Rosenstein as a partisan Democratic hack. He also has apparently forgotten that he personally appointed Rosenstein to this position. In a May interview, Trump said that Rosenstein is \u201chighly respected. Very good guy, very smart guy. And the Democrats like him. The Republicans like him.\u201d Now that Rosenstein appointed a special counsel to investigate Russia and the Trump campaign, things have changed.

Bijou St.\nFree; for more information, call 578-8847 or write to comics@escapevelocity-comics.com.\nPropped against a wire book holder, a fairly flimsy black-and-white booklet called Velvet Garden, faced the throngs at last spring's GalaxyFest. The booklet sat at Ryan Davis' vendor table, and enough people bought his pitch \u2014 and the \"rough\" of his new comic \u2014 to fund a limited run of a full-color glossy version.\nIn June, at the 2012 Denver Comic Con, he made more than 100 sales, enough to publish the next issue.\nDavis is a 30-year-old with a dream: He wants to break into the big time in the comic book industry. He and his partner, Colorado Springs artist Gunther Goltz, have come up with what they hope will be a winning story that will catch the attention of big names.\n\"There are basically two ways of breaking into the business,\" says Steven Seagle, the Colorado Springs-bred co-founder of Man of Action Studios (creators of Cartoon Network's Ben 10), supervising producer for Disney XD's Ultimate Spider-man series, and veteran comic book writer for both DC and Marvel Comics. \"You can either produce your own comic, or you can know someone in the business.\n\"If you produce your own comic,\" he advises, \"do it from top to bottom. Find a way to get it out to the world. Self-publish it. This is your calling card.\"\nVelvet Garden is based on a 1980s urban legend about a psychoactive video game machine called Polybius, released by the U.S. government as an experiment in mind control. Davis and Goltz will officially unveil the second issue Saturday, Aug. 25, at Escape Velocity, the comics-and-graphic-novels store where they both work. But they've been selling and giving out samples for several weeks.\nWith Velvet Garden, they're actually debuting the three-volume, 18-issue series with Volume No. 2. Davis, who wrote the story, and Goltz, the illustrator, decided that it would showcase the story line better than the first volume, a prequel that goes into the game's background.\n\"In the first issue, the reader learns about Hitler's experiments with mind control, and some of the machines he built, but we didn't want readers to think the series was a World War II story, because it's not,\" Davis says. \"So, we went with the second volume, which takes place in the '80s.\"\nThe first (chronologically) of the three-volume set is called Wicked Garden, and the last, which is set in Colorado Springs, is titled Neon Garden. All three will eventually be made into distinct graphic novels, each made up of six serialized comic books.\nThough he's been in the business for a decade, Davis has worked with the single focus of breaking into the industry for about a year. That started with co-creating a publishing company called Ruby Carriage, through which he produced several Internet-based comics before this current endeavor.\nHaving a central location or imprint where people can find all his work makes things easier, but doesn't cover all the bases. Seagle says most comic fans still want something they can hold, and publishers want to see good-quality artwork.\n\"The quality has got to be great. It has to be the same as, say, your favorite comic, but in an original voice only you can provide...", "gen_completion": " It takes a lot of work for people to pull them off the shelf,\" he adds. \"That's a whole different thing than you make them at a retail store.\"\nDavis, meanwhile, does most of the hard work. \"I come in the morning and shoot some stuff. We start in the afternoon; everyone on the crew's in there,\" he says. \"That does it.

Propped against a wire book holder, a fairly flimsy black-and-white booklet called Velvet Garden, faced the throngs at last spring's GalaxyFest. The booklet sat at Ryan Davis' vendor table, and enough people bought his pitch \u2014 and the \"rough\" of his new comic \u2014 to fund a limited run of a full-color glossy version. In June, at the 2012 Denver Comic Con, he made more than 100 sales, enough to publish the next issue. Davis is a 30-year-old with a dream: He wants to break into the big time in the comic book industry. He and his partner, Colorado Springs artist Gunther Goltz, have come up with what they hope will be a winning story that will catch the attention of big names. \"There are basically two ways of breaking into the business,\" says Steven Seagle, the Colorado Springs-bred co-founder of Man of Action Studios (creators of Cartoon Network's Ben 10), supervising producer for Disney XD's Ultimate Spider-man series, and veteran comic book writer for both DC and Marvel Comics. \"You can either produce your own comic, or you can know someone in the business. \"If you produce your own comic,\" he advises, \"do it from top to bottom. Find a way to get it out to the world. Self-publish it. This is your calling card.\" Velvet Garden is based on a 1980s urban legend about a psychoactive video game machine called Polybius, released by the U.S. government as an experiment in mind control. Davis and Goltz will officially unveil the second issue Saturday, Aug. 25, at Escape Velocity, the comics-and-graphic-novels store where they both work. But they've been selling and giving out samples for several weeks. With Velvet Garden, they're actually debuting the three-volume, 18-issue series with Volume No. 2. Davis, who wrote the story, and Goltz, the illustrator, decided that it would showcase the story line better than the first volume, a prequel that goes into the game's background. \"In the first issue, the reader learns about Hitler's experiments with mind control, and some of the machines he built, but we didn't want readers to think the series was a World War II story, because it's not,\" Davis says. \"So, we went with the second volume, which takes place in the '80s.\" The first (chronologically) of the three-volume set is called Wicked Garden, and the last, which is set in Colorado Springs, is titled Neon Garden. All three will eventually be made into distinct graphic novels, each made up of six serialized comic books. Though he's been in the business for a decade, Davis has worked with the single focus of breaking into the industry for about a year. That started with co-creating a publishing company called Ruby Carriage, through which he produced several Internet-based comics before this current endeavor. Having a central location or imprint where people can find all his work makes things easier, but doesn't cover all the bases. Seagle says most comic fans still want something they can hold, and publishers want to see good-quality artwork. \"The quality has got to be great. It has to be the same as, say, your favorite comic, but in an original voice only you can provide... That's a different thing than making them so they want to buy them in a store.\" So far, Davis has done most of the work. \"I'll come in the morning and shoot a few scenes. Then, in the afternoon, everyone jumps in and works on it,\" he says. If the quality is up to par, then he's good to go. How do you know that it's a high-quality production, and what can you expect in your purchase? Davis and Goltz will show off a few samples.

And there is also the risk that an older worker might suffer a stroke or fall and suffer a debilitating injury.

In September 2009, Mixson was among a dozen people indicted on various charges, including conspiring to commit four murders, as members of the 52 Hoover Street Gangsta Crips. In September 2007, Mixson, then 17, and his brother filed an internal affairs complaint accusing police of using excessive force during an arrest on aggravated assault charges. Today, Mixson is charged with the fatal shooting of Darius Dashawn Redmon, who police say was found unconscious in the back seat of a vehicle outside the Booker T. Washington housing complex, known as the home base of the Hoover Street Gangsta Crips, on Friday. Police had entered the Booker T. complex to search for a man suspected of assaulting a cop when some 200 people interfered with their search. According to the prosecutor's office, a vehicle pulled up about 11:30 p.m. Friday to the Jersey City Police Department's West District on Communipaw Avenue with three men who told police someone had been shot. Redmon was unconscious in the back seat of the vehicle with an apparent gunshot wound to his head, the prosecutor's office said. Police found Redmon with an apparent gunshot wound to his head, the prosecutor's office said, and pulled him out of the vehicle to administer CPR until Emergency Medical Services arrived and transported the victim to the Jersey City Medical Center in critical condition. Redmon was pronounced dead shortly after 6 p.m. Saturday , a hospital spokesman said. Redmon is survived by his father and his girlfriend. Follow Anthony Borrelli on Twitter: @PSBABorrelli.

And because it causes permanent liver damage and cirrosis, it's also the No. 1 cause of liver cancer,\" she said. \"However, if it's diagnosed early, Hep C can be treated on an outpatient basis.\"\nBurstein also serves on Cuomo's AIDS Task Force, which has a goal of eliminating HIV/AIDS in New York by 2020.\nLast year, there were 573 confirmed cases of chronic and acute Hep C infection across New York. For Western New York, the state reported an infection rate of 89.9 per 100,000 population, compared to a statewide rate of 73.9 cases per 100,000.\nThe incidence of Hep C has been growing along with opioid addiction that leads to heroin use, especially among young people 20 to 40. Acute cases reported have risen by 75 precent, and over 80 percent of those were among young people. Half of cases were women, and nearly 86 percent of those infected reported a history of injection drug use. Worse, Burstein says, many of those women are of reproductive age.\n\"So we have to worry not only about infection among those women, but we have to worry about vertical transmission during pregnancy and how to manage those newborns,\" she said.\nGov. Cuomo's plan calls for increasing funding for Hep C prevention, testing and treatment programs, such as", "gen_completion": " the New York State Department of Health's (NYSDOH) Hepatitis C Prevention Network, which has reached 10 percent coverage of people at high risk for infection. Additionally, funding will increase for an HIV/Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening, testing and treatment program for people with HIV. The new plan also aims to raise awareness and educate people on Hep C while offering incentives for people to get tested and connected to treatment.\n\"There have to be more medical providers, health care providers, education providers, that work one on one in these communities, that live in these communities, that understand these social issues, that understand the underlying risk factors for all of the diseases we can control,\" she said.\nThe new Hep C strategy also encourages healthcare providers to work in partnership with community members, health care organizations, faith communities, and with high school students to help build awareness.\n\"It also requires funding.

It takes less time for a professional thief to break into your car, start it up and drive away as it does for you to walk into Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and pick up a coffee \u2013 less than two minutes in some cases. And don't presume your wheezing clunker's immune; the most stolen vehicle of 2011, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau, was the 1994 Honda Accord. \"We know that thieves never miss an opportunity to make a quick buck by stealing a car,\" says Joe Wehrle, president and CEO of NICB. \"They work weekends, nights and holidays and ironically, they are particularly busy on New Year's Day and Labor Day.\" Just how busy? 2,347 car thefts were reported on January 1, 2010, 200 more than were reported for the #2 busiest day for car thieves - Memorial Day. \u201cWhile Americans are enjoying the holidays and most have time off from work, we need to remember that holidays are just another day at the shop for vehicle thieves,\u201d the NICB said in a news release. As for the rest of the year, the following cars were the most stolen in 2011. While there isn't any way to stop a crook who really wants your ride and has the tools and know-how to make it happen, the following tips can help your car become a less inviting target and slow down, discourage or actually prevent car theft. Our natural inclination is to hide something we don't want anyone to steal, but for cars, visibility is the key to safety, say experts. Thieves prefer to work out of sight of people and electronic recording devices, so leave your car keys in the vehicle when possible. If you can avoid parking in crowded, highly visible areas, keep your keys in your pocket or in your purse or other easily accessible item. And even though you'll likely want to have your vehicle equipped with motion-activated security lights, be sure they're not shining at the moment you leave the vehicle. Motion-activated lights are the easiest thing for crooks to spot. In some areas, you may need to keep your windows rolled down so that thieves can't smell your favorite car air freshener. And if you're in a shopping or city area, you may also want to leave your trunk open, as some areas don't require a parking permit, which makes stealing your car easier. Even if you lock your doors, keep your keys handy. <sent> If you lock them in your glove compartment and don't lock your door on the inside of the car, that will make it harder for police to track down any crooks who break into your ride.

Cowboys General Manager Peter Parr explains, \u201cThe main reason we\u2019ve decided to let Johnathan play is that he wants to play. \u201cHe\u2019s achieved a lot in the game, he\u2019s achieved more than most players have in the game but the one thing he hasn\u2019t done is play in this tournament, and he\u2019s very keen to play so we\u2019ve decided to let him do it,\u201d Parr said. \u201cEveryone will want to turn up and watch Jonathan Thurston play. I sat with him the whole tournament last year, we sat together and watched it and he was so enthusiastic about it and wanted to be a part of it so it goes to show how big the tournament is, the biggest drawcard in rugby league is going to be there putting his skills on.\u201d Johns said. The second premier player to confirm he will be playing in the 2017 tournament - Shaun Johnson - who led the Warriors to the 2016 final with a spectacular individual effort, said that coming so close had made him even more determined to claim an NRL Auckland Nines title for the host club. \"Making it to the final this year in front of our home fans was an awesome buzz,\" Johnson said. \"Obviously it was a real let down not to go the whole way, but we are determined to go one better in 2017. That won't be easy when you look at the talent the other clubs have on offer. I'll admit I'm excited to see JT play he\u2019ll put on a show.\" Martin Snedden, the chief executive of Downer NRL Nines promoters Duco Events, said the presence of the glamour pair in 2017 would add to an already impressive list of star players who have graced the event. \u201cOver its 14-year history, the Nines has attracted the presence of more than 30 premiership-winning players, including 16 NRL Premiers and 18 State of Origin representatives,\u201d Snedden said. \u201cIn the 2017 edition we will have one of the strongest halves combinations in the game with Benji Marshall and Michael Morgan, and then there\u2019s the likes of Thurston, Johnson, the legendary Phil Gould, and the Warriors\u2019 blazing-fast outside backs in the form of Shaun Johnson, Dane Gillett, and Tyron Roberts.

Uber's move to join the International Association of Public Transportation (UITP) is part of a drive by Uber to improve its relationships with local authorities after a series of regulatory and legal setbacks. UITP represents public transport providers around the world, including Transport for London (TfL) - which in September stripped Uber of its operating license. Scandal-hit Uber has just had to reassure authorities it is changing the way it does business after the disclosure of a massive data breach cover-up that has prompted investigations from regulators around the world. Andrew Salzberg, Uber's head of transportation policy and research, said aligning the company with public transport authorities was a good way to make Uber a better partner for cities. Uber, currently valued at $69 billion, has been testing a more collaborative approach to regulators under its new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a shift away from a more aggressive culture under former CEO Travis Kalanick. \"One of the big emphases that Dara has made... is that we want to be better partners for the cities we operate in,\" Salzberg said.

Extreme flooding in Townsville: Significant flooding as a major weather system continues to bring widespread rainfall. For service-oriented companies reliant on people, more attention may need to be paid to the impact on productivity from extended hot spells or damaging floods. While the office might be air conditioned, employees will still be subject to sleepless nights and stressful transport disruptions, impairing their performance. And outdoor workers simply cannot work in dangerously hot conditions. Not all companies, though, face downside risk from climate change - many are well positioned to leverage new markets, innovate new products and harness new technology to address climate change. And it's not just renewables and electric vehicle (EV) companies, it's the miners of the components required for these products that stand to benefit from a future in which EVs are commonplace. It may be counterintuitive, but companies could face higher costs if they fail to address climate change mitigation and adaptation. And it is inevitable that costs will rise. However, companies will find ways to continue operating, and their employees will be forced to adapt to the new reality of extreme weather. These challenges will be more difficult to manage and will also require companies to rethink their business models in order to meet changing customer expectations.

{"prefix": "While the political ramifications of dependence on Russian natural gas are a current topic of debate within the European Union, often the talk fails to address a much larger issue of whether or not the importing of Russia\u2019s natural gas will help to meet the EU\u2019s growing demands.\nSo argues physicist Bengt S\u00f6derbergh, who recently completed a dissertation on an assessment of future Norwegian and Russian gas export levels.\nAccording to forecasts by the International Energy Agency (IEA), production of natural gas within the EU will decline from the 2006 level of 216 billion cubic metres per year (Gm3/year) to 90 Gm3/year by 2030, even as demand for gas is expected to rise significantly. The need to import gas will accordingly increase by up to 90 per cent during the period. Russia and Norway are currently the most significant suppliers of gas to the EU. Their combined share of the EU\u2019s gas imports during 2006 was 62 per cent.\nAs part of S\u00f6derbergh\u2019s analysis with regard to the future levels of Norwegian and Russian gas exports to the EU, Norwegian and Russian gas production scenarios were developed based on modelling of production from individual gas fields. As a result, the combined production from the largest fields \u2013 the so-called \u201cgiant fields\u201d \u2013 was forecast.\nEU energy security is significantly dependent on production from a relatively small number of Norwegian and Russian fields. Almost all of Norway\u2019s production derives from 18 large fields, 9 of which are classifiable as giant fields.\nEssentially all of Russia\u2019s production derives from 36 giant fields.\nThe findings show that there is little potential for an increase in the level of Norwegian gas exports to the EU. All of the scenarios studied indicate that Norwegian gas production will be in decline by 2030, by which year Norwegian gas deliveries to the EU via pipeline may have fallen by as much as 20 per cent from today\u2019s level.\nAdditionally, a study of potential production from Russian giant fields indicates a maximum increase of 45 per cent in the level of Russian gas exports to the EU by 2030. In absolute terms, this corresponds to approximately 70", "gen_completion": " Tm3/year in 2030. A major new contribution from the Russian giant fields over the next 16 to 18 years would be in supplying the domestic market.\nBy contrast, the Norwegian scenario forecasts a decline in Norwegian production from nearly half now to 20 per cent by 2030. The maximum increase in exports to the EU would correspond to a rise of no more than 50 per cent. The decline in production from Norwegian giant fields would therefore be in line with the IEA projection of declining production for Norway.\nThe Russian scenario, on the other hand, has a much more uncertain outlook. The study shows that the level of Norwegian exports to the EU would more than offset a reduction in production in Russia because it has much more global trading potential. Based on the Russian scenario, exports from the Norwegian giant fields may well increase by more than 50 per cent by 2030, exceeding projections from the IEA.\nSource: NTB scanpix / Norway Today\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\nFollow us on Twitter /", "paraphrase_outputs": {"lex_40_order_100": {"final_input": "lexical = 40, order = 100 While the political ramifications of dependence on Russian natural gas are a current topic of debate within the European Union, often the talk fails to address a much larger issue of whether or not the importing of Russia\u2019s natural gas will help to meet the EU\u2019s growing demands. So argues physicist Bengt S\u00f6derbergh, who recently completed a dissertation on an assessment of future Norwegian and Russian gas export levels. According to forecasts by the International Energy Agency (IEA), production of natural gas within the EU will decline from the 2006 level of 216 billion cubic metres per year (Gm3/year) to 90 Gm3/year by 2030, even as demand for gas is expected to rise significantly. The need to import gas will accordingly increase by up to 90 per cent during the period. Russia and Norway are currently the most significant suppliers of gas to the EU. Their combined share of the EU\u2019s gas imports during 2006 was 62 per cent. As part of S\u00f6derbergh\u2019s analysis with regard to the future levels of Norwegian and Russian gas exports to the EU, Norwegian and Russian gas production scenarios were developed based on modelling of production from individual gas fields. As a result, the combined production from the largest fields \u2013 the so-called \u201cgiant fields\u201d \u2013 was forecast. EU energy security is significantly dependent on production from a relatively small number of Norwegian and Russian fields. Almost all of Norway\u2019s production derives from 18 large fields, 9 of which are classifiable as giant fields. Essentially all of Russia\u2019s production derives from 36 giant fields. The findings show that there is little potential for an increase in the level of Norwegian gas exports to the EU. All of the scenarios studied indicate that Norwegian gas production will be in decline by 2030, by which year Norwegian gas deliveries to the EU via pipeline may have fallen by as much as 20 per cent from today\u2019s level. Additionally, a study of potential production from Russian giant fields indicates a maximum increase of 45 per cent in the level of Russian gas exports to the EU by 2030. In absolute terms, this corresponds to approximately 70 Tm3 in 2030. The main contribution from the Russian giant fields in the coming 16 to 18 years will be in terms of domestic consumption. In contrast, the Norwegian scenario suggests a decline from the present level of Norwegian gas production to only 20 per cent by the year 2030. The maximum possible increase in exports to the EU by that year is 50 per cent. The decline in production from Norwegian giant fields therefore fits with the IEA\u2019s forecast of declining production in Norway. On the other hand, the Russian scenario is far more uncertain. <sent> The study shows that the level of Norwegian exports to the EU would more than offset a reduction in production in Russia because it has much more global trading potential.

{"prefix": "Law enforcement officers, including a sniper perched atop an armored vehicle, watch as demonstrators protest the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo., Aug. 13, 2014. The police chief of this St. Louis suburb said Wednesday that Brown injured the officer who later fatally shot the unarmed 18 year old though witnesses dispute that such an altercation occurred.\nAfter delivering remarks last night from the White House, President Obama fielded some questions from reporters and made a comment that stood out for me. \u201c[T]he vast majority of the community [in Ferguson] has been working very hard to try to make sure that this becomes an opportunity for us to seize the moment and turn this into a positive situation,\u201d he said.\nIt sounded like a nice-but-unrealistic goal. Years of systemic problems contributed to these crisis conditions, and the idea of turning the Michael Brown tragedy into something constructive is hard to fathom.\nThat said, over the summer, there was a fair amount of interest in one specific area: the militarization of local law enforcement. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) chaired a Senate hearing in September, and reforms to the Pentagon\u2019s \u201c1033\u201d program were endorsed by some Republicans, including Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). In the House, Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) drafted legislation.\nSo what happened? Part of the problem is the political world\u2019s short attention span. Congress was interested in local law enforcement having military equipment for policing, right up until it was time for a debate on whether President Obama was soft on Ebola Terrorists in Mexico.\nBut as Evan McMorris-Santoro reported, other considerations also played a factor.\nPolice groups rallied around 1033, scaring off many potential supporters, according to staff involved with moving the issue forward on the Hill. Police lobbyists argue that the equipment provided by 1033 keeps officers safe and keeps them prepared to deal with terrorist attacks and other threats.\n\u201cWe got a lot of pushback we got from law enforcement,\u201d said one Republican staffer involved in the militarization debate. The police lobby spread \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d about the congressional efforts, which were by this point generally united in banning only the deadly equipment from 1033 while leaving the rest of the program largely in place.\nThe calendar moved into election season,", "gen_completion": " which made gun rights advocates\u2019 efforts in this arena a bit tougher.

But a good part of the public\u2019s interest in these issues centered around the militarization of the police.\nThe military has long supported the idea of modern police forces having some kind of weaponry.

The police chief of this St. Louis suburb said Wednesday that Brown injured the officer who later fatally shot the unarmed 18 year old though witnesses dispute that such an altercation occurred. After delivering remarks last night from the White House, President Obama fielded some questions from reporters and made a comment that stood out for me. \u201c[T]he vast majority of the community [in Ferguson] has been working very hard to try to make sure that this becomes an opportunity for us to seize the moment and turn this into a positive situation,\u201d he said. It sounded like a nice-but-unrealistic goal. Years of systemic problems contributed to these crisis conditions, and the idea of turning the Michael Brown tragedy into something constructive is hard to fathom. That said, over the summer, there was a fair amount of interest in one specific area: the militarization of local law enforcement. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) chaired a Senate hearing in September, and reforms to the Pentagon\u2019s \u201c1033\u201d program were endorsed by some Republicans, including Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). In the House, Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) drafted legislation. So what happened? Part of the problem is the political world\u2019s short attention span. Congress was interested in local law enforcement having military equipment for policing, right up until it was time for a debate on whether President Obama was soft on Ebola Terrorists in Mexico. But as Evan McMorris-Santoro reported, other considerations also played a factor. Police groups rallied around 1033, scaring off many potential supporters, according to staff involved with moving the issue forward on the Hill. Police lobbyists argue that the equipment provided by 1033 keeps officers safe and keeps them prepared to deal with terrorist attacks and other threats. \u201cWe got a lot of pushback we got from law enforcement,\u201d said one Republican staffer involved in the militarization debate. The police lobby spread \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d about the congressional efforts, which were by this point generally united in banning only the deadly equipment from 1033 while leaving the rest of the program largely in place. The calendar moved into election season, which made gun-control advocates\u2019 work a little more difficult. The House passed a version of the bill. The Senate was ready to take it up. But President Obama vetoed the bill. The Senate took up the issue again, but he vetoed it again. And then it died. Some might say these are just excuses, reasons to avoid addressing the issue.

The doctor-entrepreneur-vintner, best known for inventing the angioplasty balloon, runs the Thomas Fogarty Winery just a few miles uphill from his medtech incubator at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View.\nThe non-profit Fogarty Institute for Innovation is based around a simple concept: Making life easier for small or early stage medtech firms developing cutting-edge products or tools. In an interview with Fast Company, Fogarty decried what he saw as the increasing cost of American medical innovation, and said that small medical companies need a safe environment for growth similar to those of lower-overhead conventional tech startups.\nSince its founding in 2007, the Institute has helped about a dozen small medical companies launch. Back in June, the Institute announced its latest crop of participants. The five new companies are primarily centered around providing services for expectant parents or newborn children. Among them are a non-invasive sensor that records fetal vital signs, a device that prevents vaginal tearing during childbirth, and a sensor set for clinicians giving urgent care to newborns.\nFirst Pulse Medical: First Pulse manufactures one of the first attempts at a heart rate monitor for fetuses during labor and delivery. The monitor uses proprietary light sensors to track a fetus's heart rate and oxygenation.\nInPress Technologies: InPress is testing a single-use medical device which quickly and effectively treats postpartum hemorrhaging (PPH) as it happens by stimulating vaginal contractions. One woman dies from PPH every four minutes.\nMaterna Medical: Materna is conducting tests in Australia on an anti-vaginal tearing device for women giving birth. The mechanical dilator is inserted during the first stage of labor and is designed to prevent vaginal tearing or pelvic damage during childbirth.\nMedical Cue: Medical Cue's NeoCue system is a combination sensor set/workflow organizing tool for childbirth. The system automatically gives medical professionals key physiologic data and real-time decision guidance.\nPrescient Surgical: Prescient Surgical's Cleancision device prevents dangerous surgical wound infections. This Stanford University spin-off is targeting a very specific market--obese patients undergoing colorectal surgery.\nDuring our conversation, which jumped from Fogarty's anger at the press for publishing (in his opinion) to many scare stories about medical innovation to the interaction between his institute and the larger Silicon Valley tech scene, he said something interesting. \u201cThe venture capital community has largely avoided medical companies because of the expenses associated with it.

Not every 79-year-old surgeon who runs a tech incubator happens to have a winery either. But Thomas Fogarty does. The doctor-entrepreneur-vintner, best known for inventing the angioplasty balloon, runs the Thomas Fogarty Winery just a few miles uphill from his medtech incubator at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View. The non-profit Fogarty Institute for Innovation is based around a simple concept: Making life easier for small or early stage medtech firms developing cutting-edge products or tools. In an interview with Fast Company, Fogarty decried what he saw as the increasing cost of American medical innovation, and said that small medical companies need a safe environment for growth similar to those of lower-overhead conventional tech startups. Since its founding in 2007, the Institute has helped about a dozen small medical companies launch. Back in June, the Institute announced its latest crop of participants. The five new companies are primarily centered around providing services for expectant parents or newborn children. Among them are a non-invasive sensor that records fetal vital signs, a device that prevents vaginal tearing during childbirth, and a sensor set for clinicians giving urgent care to newborns. First Pulse Medical: First Pulse manufactures one of the first attempts at a heart rate monitor for fetuses during labor and delivery. The monitor uses proprietary light sensors to track a fetus's heart rate and oxygenation. InPress Technologies: InPress is testing a single-use medical device which quickly and effectively treats postpartum hemorrhaging (PPH) as it happens by stimulating vaginal contractions. One woman dies from PPH every four minutes. Materna Medical: Materna is conducting tests in Australia on an anti-vaginal tearing device for women giving birth. The mechanical dilator is inserted during the first stage of labor and is designed to prevent vaginal tearing or pelvic damage during childbirth. Medical Cue: Medical Cue's NeoCue system is a combination sensor set/workflow organizing tool for childbirth. The system automatically gives medical professionals key physiologic data and real-time decision guidance. Prescient Surgical: Prescient Surgical's Cleancision device prevents dangerous surgical wound infections. This Stanford University spin-off is targeting a very specific market--obese patients undergoing colorectal surgery. During our conversation, which jumped from Fogarty's anger at the press for publishing (in his opinion) to many scare stories about medical innovation to the interaction between his institute and the larger Silicon Valley tech scene, he said something interesting. \u201cThe venture capital community has largely avoided medical companies because of the expenses associated with it. There are also many other problems, but primarily they're regulatory. We need more clinical research [for products] in addition to basic research...

One such dispersal order was put in place following the stabbing of a 15-year-old boy in the city centre on Sunday, February 2. This meant officers could move on any groups hanging around in the city centre if it\u2019s suspected they could be a crime or anti-social behaviour threat. If those moved along came back, then they faced possibly being arrested. Coventry stabbing reaction: \"Where are the parents?\" The teenager was found with knife injuries to his leg and lower torso in Trinity Street shortly before 6pm and was taken to hospital. His injuries were not life-changing and he was released from hospital just hours later. Dispersal orders are not a new action that police can take, however they aren&apos;t always used. So we asked the Commander of Coventry Police, Chief Superintendent Mike O&apos;Hara, why one was used on Sunday and what came of it. Q: Why was this stabbing deemed serious enough to put the dispersal order in place? A: The stabbing was deemed serious enough by the duty Inspector on the evening to put the order in place, due to the fact that groups were congregating in the area. The groups soon dispersed following increased police presence in the area. Q: Was the order actually used by officers on Sunday or Monday to move anyone along or did it result in any arrests? A: I cannot confirm at this stage the specific details of the use of the order, however, previous use of the dispersal power has proven very effective in removing problematic individuals from the city centre and preventing potential issues. Officers have utilised search powers on numerous individuals in the area resulting in a drugs arrest. Q: Is the use of dispersal orders something you are now considering using more often in the wake of incidents like this?

Search advertising makes up about 40 percent of all online ad spending, and Google has a stranglehold on that segment of the market. By comparison to Yahoo, Google last week reported second-quarter revenue of US$5.37 billion, up 39 percent over the same quarter last year. Almost all of Google's revenue comes from search advertising. It earned $4.63 per share. The Yahoo/Google search ad outsourcing deal is being reviewed by U.S. regulators and hasn't been implemented yet. Yahoo has said the deal with Google will give it a revenue boost while allowing Yahoo to continue honing its search advertising business, a key component of a broad advertising strategy that also includes the display ad formats, an area where Yahoo traditionally has been strong. President Sue Decker said Yahoo is focusing on innovating in search technology, as opposed to trying to replicate the current models, because the company believes the search experience can be greatly improved. For the third quarter, Yahoo expects revenue in the range of $1.78 billion - $1.81 billion, which would be down between 7 percent and 13 percent from the same quarter last year. Earnings per share is expected to be between 5 cents and 15 cents, in line with analyst expectations. For the third quarter, operating income is expected to grow between 5 percent and 15 percent. Non-interest expenses are expected to grow between 10 percent and 15 percent. For the year, Yahoo expects its total long-term debt to be between $11.1 billion and $12.5 billion. For the third quarter, Yahoo has about 11.3 billion consolidated members, up from 1 billion at the beginning of the year. Yahoo has 21.7 million active users daily on its services and Web sites, and about a billion members who use its e-mail, instant messenger and other tools. <sent> The company reported total average revenue per user of a record $10.7 at the end of the second quarter.

She points to a recent New York Times Magazine story on the difficulties many PR clients face, and the difficulty of explaining to clients that the use of testimonials for endorsements and promotions is also a violation of their ethics rules. \"It gets into the gray area where you get into the business case and the business case should not come in when you're just putting something up to sell.\"\nThe issue isn't new.

Since the days when the snake-oil salesman would roll into town with a well-placed accomplice in the crowd to support bogus medicinal claims during his sales pitch, promotions professionals have struggled with issues of transparency and full disclosure. The Web has replaced the stage outside the covered wagon as the venue of choice, but the issues are still very relevant as word-of-mouth marketing and testimonials remain effective promotional strategies. So, when is the line between creative publicity tactics and deceptive practices crossed? The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has maintained its Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising for decades. In 2009, the FTC updated the guides to, among other things, specifically address the use of testimonials in blogs, social media, and other online outlets. It's a fairly simple premise - where there is a material connection between the speaker and brand that the audience would not other-wise reasonably infer, a disclosure is needed. One of the FTC's first enforcement actions after the new guides were issued was against a PR firm. Reverb Communications had hyped the products of its video-game clients by posting glowing reviews in the iTunes store without disclosing it was paid to promote those games. It was clearly a deceptive practice. The same disclosure issues can arise in many different campaigns, whether in comments on a blog, threads on a social media site, product placement deals, even coordinated efforts between journalists and marketers. PR pros and their clients have a long history of promoting the sanctity of truth-in-advertising and supporting the need for ad transparency. And consumers are quick to call out questionable testimonials. But the problem that PR people gloss over or ignore - and the one that makes no sense - is the use of testimonials in endorsements and promotions. It's not so much a question of saying this or that; it's more a question of when is it appropriate to post a testimonial in the first place, says Karen Newman, VP of marketing communications for the American Public Relations Association. She points to a recent article in the New York Times Magazine about the challenges many public relations people face in explaining to clients that the use of testimonials for endorsements and promotions is also a violation of their ethics code. \"It's a gray area where you're getting into business, and business shouldn't be a part of it.\" <sent> The issue isn't new.

Back in April, I had the honour of attending the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York City, alongside several of my colleagues. This was the 16th-annual conference at the UN dedicated exclusively to discussing the issues facing the world\u2019s indigenous populations. The forum brought the world together on the 10th anniversary of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, or UNDRIP. As we embark on a new year, it\u2019s important to take time to focus on what the future holds for our communities in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding and our country as a whole. When we consider the future, our youth always must be a priority as they will inherit the outcome of any decisions our current leadership makes. The youth of today are engaged in a way we\u2019ve never seen before. According to a study by Abacus Data and the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, youth turnout jumped by 12 percentage points between the 2011 and 2015 elections. In July of this year, in a speech by U.S. Congressman Trey Gowdy to the students of Liberty University, Gowdy shared two questions he posed to those employed at his office. The first question was which do you value more: truth or freedom? Everyone present answered they valued freedom more than truth. The second question was which do you value more: unity or diversity? Everyone except one answered they valued diversity more than unity. Oct. 19 marked one full year that I have had the honour and privilege of representing the people of Thunder Bay-Rainy River in Parliament.
