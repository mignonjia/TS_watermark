Alex, who turns 12 on Tuesday, flew out on a pre-agreed trip with Melanie Batty, 37, and David Batty, 58, for a week-long stay in the Benahavis area, near Marbella. However they did not come back home as expected on Sunday October 8. Inquiries have revealed they may have tried to sail on the same date from Malaga to Melilla on the Moroccan border. Alex's guardian, grandmother Susan Caruana, 62, says her daughter and ex-husband previously lived on a commune in Morocco with Alex in 2014 as part of an \"alternative lifestyle\" which she believes lies behind the youngster's disappearance. She said: \"On the Sunday, they were due back in the afternoon and my husband was going to go and pick them up. I got this message on Facebook and it was a YouTube video of the three of them. \"They all spoke on it and Melanie said the reasons why they had done what they had done. \"Alex said it was a million times better being with his mum and granddad. Obviously it hurt me a bit but then my other concerns kicked in. \"The reason I believe they have done this is because basically my lifestyle, my belief systems, are not what they agree with - just simply living day to day, how normal people do. \"They didn't want him to go to school, they don't believe in mainstream school.\" She added: \"I just want to say to my grandson Alex, I love you so much and please, please just get in contact. \"We always did something nice with him on his birthday. We'd have a party or go bowling with his friends, his cousins and that. \"But he said 'no one will ever see that again, mum and dad.' He said that on the video. \"I hope they come home soon and that Alex gets in touch with me so I can stop worrying about him.\" Police say she has no contact with either of the men and they both live in the Algarve in southern Portugal with their son David, 47.

Under the new system, average citizens will work alongside judges to issue verdicts in many criminal cases. As Yuriko Nagano reports from Tokyo, the greatest hurdle to the experiment is expected to be persuading Japanese citizens to participate. In Japan, as in most Asian countries, judges alone make decisions in trials. But starting in 2009, juries will be participating in Japanese courts, under what is called a \"saibanin\" system. The new system has not yet been confirmed. At first, it will be tested for three years. And it will be limited in scope. Juries will only be used in certain criminal cases, involving serious crimes such as murder. Robert Precht, a U.S. defense lawyer and legal scholar at the University of Montana, is helping Japanese judges, prosecutors, defense lawyers and citizens to implement the change. He spoke to journalists in Tokyo on Thursday. \"The saibanin system and these other reforms are intended to transform Japanese citizens from viewing themselves as governed objects into governing objects,\" Precht says. For each trial, there will be a panel of three judges and six jurors, who will be citizens selected at random. The jury panel will sit in the same room with the judges to deliberate on the evidence and reach a verdict. If the verdict is guilty, the jurors will also vote on the sentence, and their votes will be equal to those of the judges. The aim, Precht says, is to bring more transparency to the criminal justice system. \"The hope for these reforms is that we will transform society \u2014 society as it has known itself \u2014 from one governed by the government to one governing itself,\" says Precht. The use of juries in Japan dates back to World War II. But they were dropped in 1971, after being criticized as ineffective. Under the new system, Japanese citizens must ask to be selected for jury duty. The first case will be held next month. But the government and the judiciary are still very much against the idea.

The Seattle-based online service plans to roll out its Zillow Offers program by fall, buying houses from sellers in as little as a week and then turning around and selling them for a higher price, the company said. Orlando joins nine other cities where Zillow has already launched the service along with four other areas getting Zillow Offers this fall: Miami, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Nashville and Portland. It joins a handful of other services such as Opendoor, Offerpad and Rex that will either buy houses directly from consumers or circumvent the traditional real estate agent model. Online home buying services have been controversial among real estate professionals because of worries that they cut out local agents and try to take advantage of rising real estate prices. Zillow said it does plan to work with local real estate agents on deals, or refer buyers to local agents if the Zillow\u2019s offer isn\u2019t accepted. \"It's clear people want a convenient, stress-free way to sell their home, and real estate professionals are eager to work with us to leverage Zillow Offers as a way to build their local businesses,\u201d said Zillow Brand President Jeremy Wacksman. \u201cWith today's announcement, we are excited to we will work with some of the most experienced and talented agents in the region to help them scale.\" The company plans to spend more than $100 million in its new markets through 2023, most of it from outside investors. \"As the company scales and invests, we will continue to focus on our expertise in residential real estate, which is why we are well-positioned to bring people to the marketplace who are not familiar with local markets like Orlando,\" Wacksman said..

But only a year ago, she was a relative unknown whose audiences were rooted mainly in YouTube subscriptions.\nKelly, who auditioned for American Idol's ninth season as a teenager in 2010, was cut from the show just before the its live semi-finals after some particularly harsh criticism from judge Simon Cowell. While the rejection hit Kelly hard, she told Ryan Seacrest last year it incited her to buckle down on her craft and prove her worth as a musician.\n\"I was bummed when I got cut, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then it was kind of awesome because, I think, by getting cut from the show, something stirred up in me to want to write.\"\nAnd that's precisely what she did. In 2012, after releasing six-track EP Handmade Songs By Tori Kelly that Kelly, herself, produced in her bedroom, the singer caught Scooter Braun's eye, and found herself under Capitol Records' management within the year. A second EP, Foreword, continued to cultivate a fan base, and demonstrated her appeal as a complete, wild-maned package.\nIt was 2015, though, that signaled Kelly's rise into official breakthrough artist territory.

He is a former \u2018enemy\u2019 now in our midst. It is not without irony that Robson\u2019s probable introduction at the highest level coincides with England\u2019s stated attempt to regain a more \u2018English\u2019 feel to the national team. Yet England will have no hesitation in making him Alastair Cook\u2019s opening partner for the first Test against Sri Lanka if he carries on the form for Middlesex which saw him score 1,180 first-class runs last season at 47. \u2018Look, I grew up in Australia,\u2019 said Robson. \u2018I still go back there occasionally and my family live there. Robson, a technically accomplished opener with a hint of Mike Atherton about him, already has one influential supporter in director of cricket at Middlesex and England selector Angus Fraser. \u2018It\u2019s going to be a challenge for him this summer because a lot of people are going to be looking at him but that was the case in the winter when, as an \u201cAussie\u201d boy as such, he succeeded in Australia with the Lions, which showed he\u2019s got a lot of nous,\u2019 said Fraser. Robson appeared for Australia Under 19s and so disappointed are they to lose him that they changed their eligibility rules to make it easier for him to play domestic cricket as a non-overseas player. But the lad\u2019s head is not for turning, despite attempts from his Middlesex colleague Chris Rogers to turn it, not even after seeing his adopted country thrashed by his native one. The coaches who have worked with Robson believe he is ready for Test cricket. Does he? \u2018I know how important the next couple of months with Middlesex are going to be and if I keep performing well you never know. I\u2019ll just do my best and see how we go,\u2019 he said. And if and when the call comes, Robson is adamant that he will even have the support of his Australian father, who works as a coach in the indoor school at the iconic Sydney Cricket Ground. \u2018Both my parents have always been totally supportive,\u2019 said Robson. \u2018It\u2019s just the way my life has panned out. It would be even more amazing if he opens the batting at Lord\u2019s against Australia next year. HE MUST BE BETTER THAN 'RAT WHO JOINED SINKING SHIP'! In the 19th Century, Trott, the only man to have cleared the Lord\u2019s pavilion with a six, played Tests for both countries. The \u2018rat who joined the sinking ship\u2019. McCague was said to be a big, brutish fast bowler. He was certainly big (about two stone overweight) but his bowling was help-yourself stuff. An all-rounder, below, who didn\u2019t seem good enough with bat or ball. Played well at times but was no \u2018new Botham\u2019. 4. Jason Gallian (1995) Top-order batter who was not quite up to it.

A member of the Australian team in that series, the Board said Galliano had been \u2018shaken up\u2019 and that \u2018the poor example he was setting his son\u2019, his behaviour, was \u2018appalling\u2019 under the pressure of a major international tour, with a full training programme and a team that needed \u2018tactical perfection\u2019, which required his removal.

Over 500 absentee ballots have come into the Somerset town clerk's office which Ms. Hart said is a lot. The absentee ballots have mostly been for people who go to live in Florida during the colder months of the year, college students and nursing home residents. Somerset has about 12,600 registered voters. \"We're getting a lot of voters who are going to vote Democrat,\" Ms Hart said. \"They have to be out of the country for several months, so I don't know if they will actually vote on election day.\" In a state referendum, voters in Somerset will be deciding if they agree or disagree with a proposal that could affect the entire town if approved by the voters.

On the back of the vase, label each layer of sand with the name of the beach it came from and the date you collected it. You can write this information on the vase with permanent marker, or print out labels with a label maker and stick them on the container. Small stones and objects from the beach, such as sand dollars, seashells and coral, give your vase an even more tropical feel. To fill the vase with sand dollars, use a metal funnel with a collection of rocks, seashells, coral and other items that fit inside. Keep your eye on the vase to make sure none of the sand dollars fall out. You can add a touch of fun and flair to your vase by adding a pair of colorful flowers.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, an unnamed YouTube spokesman gave more details: With Binge On, participating services agree to reduce video quality to 480p resolution in exchange for not counting against users\u2019 data caps. YouTube is not yet participating in the program due to technical issues, yet its videos are getting downgraded to 480p anyway. T-Mobile hasn\u2019t responded directly to the accusations, except to say that users have the option to turn off Binge On whenever they want. This doesn\u2019t address whether Binge On reduces non-participating videos to 480p resolution. It\u2019s possible that T-Mobile just thought it was doing the right thing. After all, users who are happy with unlimited 480p video might also want the same video quality across the board, so that even non-participating video sources consume less data. The problem is that T-Mobile hasn\u2019t been up-front about its policies, so users can\u2019t make an informed decision. Even now, the company won\u2019t acknowledge in its press statements how its throttling policy applies to non-Binge On sources, and the company\u2019s statement on Binge On says only that participating services won\u2019t be able to use more than their monthly data allowance. This is in spite of T-Mobile\u2019s own rules, which say that video services like Binge On, YouTube Red, and T-Mobile\u2019s own T-V app are allowed up to 5GB of monthly data for video. The T-Mobile data plan for that 5GB limit costs an extra $10 per month, so throttling those services would cut into those revenues\u2014exactly the kind of thing T-Mobile says it wants to avoid. But the Internet Association isn\u2019t so sure, and has called for the FCC to cancel Binge On outright for its abuses. It\u2019s also possible that T-Mobile\u2019s Binge On app is throttling all traffic, including YouTube. <sent> The group\u2019s petition to </sent>", "output": ["Binge On says only that participating services won\u2019t be able to use more than their monthly data allowance.

Although the rate ended slightly lower on the day, this rally in EURUSD is still expected to continue near term.\nThis most recent high continues to support a Euro forecast that targets the key 1.4281 reversal level of November 4th, 2010 in the coming sessions.

That level now remains key support to break in order to see further downside for USDJPY.\nUntil that support point breaks, look for additional corrective activity to the upside to prevail, with the current consolidation taking on the look of a possible pennant formation that could resolve into another sharp rally of a similar magnitude to that seen from 0.7641 to 81.98.\nThe Aussie rallied as far as 1.0127 on Tuesday and made a fresh recent high in its most recent sharp rise.

In addition, the Aussie gained substantial ground, while the Yen was mildly higher. A more technical EURUSD analysis shows that the rate made another fresh recent high on Tuesday at the 1.4247 level within an impressive rally that commenced at the important 1.2873 reversal point of January 10th. Although the rate ended slightly lower on the day, this rally in EURUSD is still expected to continue near term. This most recent high continues to support a Euro forecast that targets the key 1.4281 reversal level of November 4th, 2010 in the coming sessions. Above that major resistance point, resistance then shows up at the 1.4579 level for EURUSD. In addition, the rate\u2019s key 200-day Moving Average is now at 1.3321 and rising. This indicates a bullish medium term outlook for the rate and its level should effectively limit downside price action until a significant trend reversal takes place in EURUSD. Although EURUSD\u2019s 14-day RSI has come off somewhat from its former almost overbought levels seen during last week\u2019s dramatic rise, the indicator is still reading in the upper part of neutral territory at 66 that could impede upside price action in the near term. USDJPY spent most of Tuesday\u2019s session trading in a tight range between 80.83 and 81.27, an even tighter range than that seen the previous day. A sustained breach of either side of this range should yield a measuring objective of ~ 60 pips from the breakout point, with the rate needing to overcome resistance at 81.98 to push significantly higher. Furthermore, the chart for USDJPY is still dominated by the rate having just made a fresh post-war low of 76.41 during last Thursday\u2019s session. That level now remains key support to break in order to see further downside for USDJPY. Until that support point breaks, look for additional corrective activity to the upside to prevail, with the current consolidation taking on the look of a possible pennant formation that could resolve into another sharp rally of a similar magnitude to that seen from 0.7641 to 81.98. The Aussie rallied as far as 1.0127 on Tuesday and made a fresh recent high in its most recent sharp rise. The current up move began at 0.9704 on March 17th, and it seems to have brought AUDUSD back into its ascending wedge pattern , which has been in play since mid-February. The next important resistance level is at 1.0470, which the current rally will probably have to take out to be able to challenge this week\u2019s high of 1.049. After AUDUSD breaches the wedge pattern\u2019s upper trendline (1.0470), the pair could then move up to test its 50-day Moving Average and possibly even its 200-day Moving Average. The 1.0460 objective for AUDUSD will probably remain in play as long as resistance stands at 1.0470 (and possibly even more at 1.0460). If the pair manages to close above this resistance, it should be able to breach the wedge pattern and challenge 1.0470.

It begs the question of whether or not you can equip the vaunted \"connected home\" yet. We're close, but I think there's still some room for improvement, particularly with the various incompatible flavors of DRM out there. That said, there's a plethora of premium content out there for your viewing pleasure, and a growing number of devices to stream it and watch it on.\nThere are two ways to acquire content: record your own or download it. Each has its pluses and minuses, which I hope to discuss more over the next few months. Suffice to say that if you buy your TV commercial-free from the Apple iTunes store (we won't get into illicit downloads for now), you'll need Apple TV. If you record your own, you'll need a Media Center Edition (MCE) PC and an Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender. You can also buy and download content directly to the Xbox, but the selection on Xbox Live Marketplace is fairly sparse at this time.\nAs Windows Vista (Premium and Ultimate versions) has incorporated MCE, many new PCs will let you stream video to an Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender support. All-in-one PCs such as the HP TouchSmart IQ770 provide a wealth of media features, and rigs such as the Velocity Micro CineMagix Grand Theater are specially tailored to home theater.\nBoth the Xbox and the Apple TV sit on your network. They let you watch your TV, home videos, and photos on your TV in your living room. Xbox 360 supports 720p HDTV content, while Apple TV is limited to 480p. Apple TV works with both Windows and Macs. Predictably, Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender support is Windows-only.\nWith Slingbox Pro hooked into your home network, you're not just restricted to streaming content around the house. In fact, you can stream TV content around the world when you travel. You can receive it on a PC that has SlingPlayer software installed or to a Windows Mobile handheld running SlingPlayer Mobile.\nWhether you want your home theater strictly for home or also to go, we have a solution for you. Read on to find one that will keep you entertained.\nSo far one of two shipping MCE systems with CableCARD tuner (the other is the Sony Vaio VGX-XL3), the CineMagix is a powerful home theater-oriented system that can stream premium cable content to an Xbox 360 in your den or family room.\nThis quintessential kitchen PC can stream recorded and live content from its built-in analog cable tuner.

The popularity of media streaming devices such as Apple TV and the Xbox 360 has given a great boost to home theater. It begs the question of whether or not you can equip the vaunted \"connected home\" yet. We're close, but I think there's still some room for improvement, particularly with the various incompatible flavors of DRM out there. That said, there's a plethora of premium content out there for your viewing pleasure, and a growing number of devices to stream it and watch it on. There are two ways to acquire content: record your own or download it. Each has its pluses and minuses, which I hope to discuss more over the next few months. Suffice to say that if you buy your TV commercial-free from the Apple iTunes store (we won't get into illicit downloads for now), you'll need Apple TV. If you record your own, you'll need a Media Center Edition (MCE) PC and an Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender. You can also buy and download content directly to the Xbox, but the selection on Xbox Live Marketplace is fairly sparse at this time. As Windows Vista (Premium and Ultimate versions) has incorporated MCE, many new PCs will let you stream video to an Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender support. All-in-one PCs such as the HP TouchSmart IQ770 provide a wealth of media features, and rigs such as the Velocity Micro CineMagix Grand Theater are specially tailored to home theater. Both the Xbox and the Apple TV sit on your network. They let you watch your TV, home videos, and photos on your TV in your living room. Xbox 360 supports 720p HDTV content, while Apple TV is limited to 480p. Apple TV works with both Windows and Macs. Predictably, Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender support is Windows-only. With Slingbox Pro hooked into your home network, you're not just restricted to streaming content around the house. In fact, you can stream TV content around the world when you travel. You can receive it on a PC that has SlingPlayer software installed or to a Windows Mobile handheld running SlingPlayer Mobile. Whether you want your home theater strictly for home or also to go, we have a solution for you. Read on to find one that will keep you entertained. So far one of two shipping MCE systems with CableCARD tuner (the other is the Sony Vaio VGX-XL3), the CineMagix is a powerful home theater-oriented system that can stream premium cable content to an Xbox 360 in your den or family room. This quintessential kitchen PC can stream recorded and live content from its built-in analog cable tuner. Premium content is limited to downloads, since the TouchSmart only has an analog tuner.

The British data regulator plans to fine Facebook the maximum amount possible over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. On Tuesday, the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) announced that it will hit Facebook with a \u00a3500,000 (roughly $663,000) penalty over two breaches of the UK Data Protection Act linked to the incident, in which political research firm Cambridge Analytica misappropriated tens of millions of users' personal data. \"The ICO's investigation concluded that Facebook contravened the law by failing to safeguard people's information,\" the organisation said in a statement. \"It also found that the company failed to be transparent about how people's data was harvested by others.\" The sum is barely even a slap on the wrist for Facebook, which had revenues of more than $40 billion in 2017, but is the maximum possible under the applicable legislation. In a statement, Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: \"New technologies that use data analytics to micro-target people give campaign groups the ability to connect with individual voters. But this cannot be at the expense of transparency, fairness and compliance with the law.\" \"Fines and prosecutions punish the bad actors, but my real goal is to effect change and restore trust and confidence in our democratic system,\" she said. Facebook says it will respond \"soon\" The ICO is also launching a criminal prosecution against SCL Elections, an organisation affiliated with Cambridge Analytica, and has sent warning letters to 11 political parties and \"notices compelling them to agree to audits of their data protection policies.\" Facebook has a chance to respond to the ICO before a final decision is made on the fine. The company has said it plans to do so \"soon.\" In an emailed statement, Facebook chief privacy officer Erin Egan said: \"As we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015. We have been working closely with the ICO in their investigation of Cambridge Analytica, just as we have with authorities in the US and other countries. We're reviewing the report and will respond to the ICO soon.\" Politicians are calling to be more transparent about how the company is investigating the misuse of personal data. The opposition Labour Party is calling on Facebook to publish an independent report into the incident, while the Liberal Democrats have called on the company and the ICO to reach a \"result\" on the issue of how data was harvested. Two Lib Dem sources said the party was specifically referring to the information harvesting of up to 50 million users in the UK between the years of 2010 and 2013. It also says the regulator's investigation into other political data firms that may have misused the same data hasn't gone far enough. \"We welcome the ICO's fine and its decision to clarify the standards of conduct it expects, but it appears that since this incident started, Facebook has done more to cover it up than any other organisation,\" said Tory minister for digital Ed Vaizey. <sent> He also expressed concern about the regulatory authority's move to prosecute political parties and political observers, which he sees as a possible infringement of freedom of speech. </sent>", "output": ["to be more transparent about how the company is investigating the misuse of personal data.

LaChance also credited AKO defensive coordinator Mike Morencie, who upset the timing of the high-scoring Hamilton offence by refusing to blitz and had his players drop into coverage the entire game. \u201cWe watched the film and saw where they beat us,\u201d Crumb said. \u201cWe played a lot of coverage and manned up their best receivers. Crumb notched his first of three interceptions on Hamilton\u2019s opening possession and it set up the first of three Anthony Malandruccolo field goals to put AKO on the board first. Austin Lumley\u2019s one-yard score pushed Windsor\u2019s lead to 10-0 as the offence found success on the ground. Josh Wright batted down a ball in the end zone forcing Hamilton to kick a field goal to make it a one-score game in the third quarter. Malandruccolo\u2019s second field goal restored the 10-point AKO lead and after Hamilton cut it to a one-score on another field goal off a blocked punt, Malandruccolo\u2019s third field goal made it 16-6. The final score didn\u2019t get any closer as the Hurricanes dropped to 6-7. \u201cWe never intended not to win or be physical, because you have to be physical to win today,\u201d said Windsor forward Sam D\u2019Anteho. \u201cOur seniors will have to go through this all over again, it\u2019s something they\u2019ve wanted all year.\u201d <sent> The Hurricanes also finished tied for third in the OCA with just nine defensive defensive touchdowns allowed. Windsor won a league title for just the fourth time, matching their league record of three times (1996, 1997, 1998).

Until recently, Zika was expected to cause little more than flu-like symptoms \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists fever, joint pain and a headache \u2014 in about 20 percent of the people it infected. The rapid spread of the virus and potential connection to an otherwise rare birth defect have drawn plenty of attention from the public and from government officials. In January, the National Institutes of Health made Zika virus research a high priority, and the groundwork underway at UW\u2013Madison led to NIH support for a series of studies of the virus in macaques, monkeys whose physiology and immune systems are similar to humans. The researchers will track the effects of initial infections, but also try to establish whether one Zika virus infection provides some protection against future infection \u2014 like chicken pox does. Zika does not mutate particularly fast, the feature of HIV and influenza that makes those viruses hard to pin down with vaccines (like HIV) and leaves people open to reinfection seasonally (like flu). This may make Zika easier to head off with a vaccine, but the best sort of immune response to provoke with a vaccine is not yet yet known. In fact, it\u2019s possible that the virus may evolve in a way that would make it harder to control because it would be less likely to evoke the kind of immune system response that would be needed. The HIV vaccine was developed before the virus was able to change in ways that made the vaccine less effective. <sent> For more information about this project, contact the Division of Biological and Clinical Sciences at hns.health@uw.edu for more information The researchers are keeping the genetic sequence of the virus close to its original, known as a wild-type, to avoid infecting monkeys with infectious Zika infection. The work in monkeys is important because, the researchers say, much more data is needed to help public health officials, clinicians and scientists decide where and when vaccines should be developed.

In breaking the sound barrier, Yeager becomes the fastest man alive \u2014 and the legend of the X-Planes begins.\nAs airplanes flew faster and faster throughout the 1930s, pilots began to experience a number of problems associated with the increased airspeed. Aircraft such as the Lockheed P-38 and Republic P-47 flew just fine at ordinary speeds in level flight. But if pilots put them in a high-speed dive, they began to experience control problems that led to the deaths of several pilots.\nThe main problem facing these pilots was the aerodynamic condition known as compressibility. Simply stated, at speeds well below the speed of sound, most of the air molecules have time to get out of the way of an aircraft as it approaches, and the density of the air does not change.\nHowever, as the speed of sound is approached, the air molecules can\u2019t get out of the way, and more of them hit the aircraft. The impact compresses the air in front of the aircraft and increases the air density. Eventually shock waves form around the airplane, affecting the lift and drag. These changes were not well-understood and led to the loss of control in several aircraft.\nBecause the effects of compressibility are directly related to the speed of sound, a ratio is used to describe the speed of an aircraft. The Mach number is the speed at which an object is traveling relative to the speed of sound at a particular temperature. The name is in honor of physicist Ernest Mach, who studied high-speed gas dynamics.\nThe Bell X-1 was developed to research aerodynamics in the transonic region, or speeds just below and just above the speed of sound. After numerous flights with civilian test pilots, Capt. Yeager of the newly formed U.S. Air Force made his first powered flight in the X-1 on Aug. 29, 1947, high over the Mojave Desert of southern California.\nThe problem Yeager was experiencing was the ineffectiveness of the X-1\u2019s pitch controls, as shock waves essentially created an aerodynamic shadow around the tail. Changes were made to the horizontal tail controls, allowing Yeager to control the airplane's ability to pitch up and down, and flights continued. This knowledge would lead to the all-flying tail, or stabilator, standard on all supersonic fighters today.\nYeager was nursing two broken ribs on the morning of Oct. 14, after being thrown from his horse on a ride the night before. He boarded the B-29 bomber that was to carry the Bell X-1 to altitude. The plan was to fly to Mach 0.97. But Yeager says the new moving tail boosted his morale, and he wanted to fly faster.\nAfter climbing down into the X-1, which was carried like a bomb in the belly of the B-29, Yeager\u2019s friend and fellow test pilot Jack Ridley handed him a short, sawed-off section of broomstick. Yeager would use it to close the canopy of the X-1, because his broken ribs prevented him from closing the latch normally.\nPeople on the ground heard what sounded like distant thunder.

I think the minister herself said this was intolerable and needs to stop now.\" It was nonsense to blame the delay in shutting down the seclusion rooms on the high and complex needs of children, Ms Grant said. Plenty of research showed other ways to deal with high-needs children without locking them away, she said. Legislation to make seclusion rooms illegal had been included into an existing bill which was making its way through the House. This meant the law might not come into force until next year. Children's Commissioner Andrew Becroft said, in the meantime, the rooms must be decommissioned immediately. \"Without underestimating the difficulty of the challenges of volatile young people, the answer has got to be desist now, stop now. \"I don't think this is a phase-out situation, this is a cease and desist situation.\" The Ministry of Education has yet to report back on its review, which investigated the number of non-special schools that had or were using seclusion rooms. What about the other two schools? Ministry of Education Head of Special Education David Wales said these schools worked with children with some of the highest and most complex needs in the country, and staff constantly dealt with difficult and highly stressful situations. \"A small number, eight, told us they were using seclusion, and we have so far had regular discussions with all of them to understand the circumstances in which seclusion might be appropriate, or how we can stop it. \" As far as we're aware, the use of seclusion is rare in special schools.\" Wales said seclusion rooms were now in \"standby\" and the ministry would have more information after a meeting this month. \"The meeting will, among other things, consider the next steps for establishing permanent safeguards, including a legal process, to ensure there are no further issues.\" All disability services, except for intellectual disability services, were working to end the use of seclusion rooms as quickly as possible. <sent> The Greens raised the issue of seclusion rooms at the Education Committee last month.

{"prefix": "Recent reforms were hailed as progress, but advocates say the system is still riddled with problems.\nRecent federal reforms aimed at protecting prisoners from exorbitant phone bills still fall short of reining in prices on the the vast majority of inmate calls, federal officials and prisoners' advocates said Wednesday.\nThe new rules, enacted in February by the Federal Communications Commission, cap prices for out-of-state calls. But most calls from prisoners are in-state communications, which remain unregulated.\nAdvocates say call fees have long been a problem for inmates and their families. Costly charges can leave prisoners with thousands of dollars in phone bills when they get out. In some cases, people have been forced to choose between phone calls and food. And children who lack regular contact with their incarcerated parents are more likely to miss school, become homeless, or suffer depression.\nThe FCC, led by interim Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn, took a step toward addressing that problem last year. The agency's ruling capped prices for interstate phone calls at 21 cents per minute for prepaid calls and 25 cents per minute for collect calls. Previous prices had exceeded $1 a minute in some cases.\nWhen the FCC put forth its original ruling in 2013, it expressed a desire to address in-state rates as well, seeking comment on possible proposals to do so. But the telephone companies that challenged the out-of-state caps have threatened opposition to in-state rules as well, and any FCC attempt to reform them would likely trigger a legal battle over the FCC's jurisdiction.\nBut with in-state calls still unregulated, some prisoners are paying much more for their local calls. In New Jersey, for instance, some in-state calls can run more than $8 for 15 minutes on the phone.\n\"The reforms thus far, though significant, have had very little impact because the majority of inmate calling is intrastate,\" said Darrell Baker, an Alabama utility official who has led that state's push to lower its call rates.\n\"The FCC's decision did a lot, but it certainly didn't help for large numbers of people,\" said Cheryl Leanza, an advocate with the United Church of Christ.\nFCC leaders, including Clyburn, Wheeler, and Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, said last year's reforms are a starting point, but agreed that in-state calls still need to be addressed.\n\"We recognize that more needs to be done,\" FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in his opening remarks at a Wednesday panel at the agency's Washington headquarters.\nThe FCC, however, is asking states to take the lead on intrastate calling. Some states \u2014 including Alabama \u2014 have taken steps to protect prisoners from predatory rates.\nSimilar to the FCC's out-of-state rules, Alabama moved recently to cap in-state call fees at 25 cents per minute.\nBut with most states still inactive on the issue, some are calling for federal intervention.\n\"The FCC has both the duty and the authority to act under the statute if states do not,\" Clyburn said.\nOthers think the FCC's role should be limited advising state officials.\n\"Much of the heavy lifting is now left to the states,\" said Jesse Wiese, who works with the faith-based criminal-justice reform group Justice Fellowship. \"We don't think the commission should regulate intrastate calls.\" Wiese said the agency should focus on working with lawmakers and regulators around the country to enact reforms.\nBut inmate calling problems aren't limited to high intrastate prices.

The agency's ruling capped prices for interstate phone calls at 21 cents per minute for prepaid calls and 25 cents per minute for collect calls. Previous prices had exceeded $1 a minute in some cases. When the FCC put forth its original ruling in 2013, it expressed a desire to address in-state rates as well, seeking comment on possible proposals to do so. But the telephone companies that challenged the out-of-state caps have threatened opposition to in-state rules as well, and any FCC attempt to reform them would likely trigger a legal battle over the FCC's jurisdiction. But with in-state calls still unregulated, some prisoners are paying much more for their local calls. In New Jersey, for instance, some in-state calls can run more than $8 for 15 minutes on the phone. \"The reforms thus far, though significant, have had very little impact because the majority of inmate calling is intrastate,\" said Darrell Baker, an Alabama utility official who has led that state's push to lower its call rates. \"The FCC's decision did a lot, but it certainly didn't help for large numbers of people,\" said Cheryl Leanza, an advocate with the United Church of Christ. FCC leaders, including Clyburn, Wheeler, and Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, said last year's reforms are a starting point, but agreed that in-state calls still need to be addressed. \"We recognize that more needs to be done,\" FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in his opening remarks at a Wednesday panel at the agency's Washington headquarters. The FCC, however, is asking states to take the lead on intrastate calling. Some states \u2014 including Alabama \u2014 have taken steps to protect prisoners from predatory rates. Similar to the FCC's out-of-state rules, Alabama moved recently to cap in-state call fees at 25 cents per minute. But with most states still inactive on the issue, some are calling for federal intervention. \"The FCC has both the duty and the authority to act under the statute if states do not,\" Clyburn said. Others think the FCC's role should be limited advising state officials. \"Much of the heavy lifting is now left to the states,\" said Jesse Wiese, who works with the faith-based criminal-justice reform group Justice Fellowship. \"We don't think the commission should regulate intrastate calls.\" Wiese said the agency should focus on working with lawmakers and regulators around the country to enact reforms. But inmate calling problems aren't limited to high intrastate prices. Many prisoners, said panelists, are frequently plagued by dropped calls. Those are generally the fault of prison officials, who often fail to maintain equipment properly, said Patricia Whorf, executive director of the Criminal Justice Resource Center in Washington. State prison officials should focus on telecommunications issues if they want to improve call rates for in-state prisoners, said Mark Leeson, vice president of the Federal Correctional Institute in Camp Hill, Pa. \"That's where the problems are,\" he said. The Bureau of Prisons conducted an audit last year of inmate calling to determine the root causes of the problems and identify possible fixes. The audit cost more than $500,000 and examined equipment and procedures in prisons across the country. <sent> The IG reviewed how many prisoners and their loved ones were receiving charges on the most common types of cell phone bills.

Both the agencies have 52 pumps (BMC 19 and Fire Services 33) pumps with them to face the situation.\nMeanwhile, the city has been divided into 13 sub-zones or sectors with senior officers taking their sectoral positions and in-charge of decision making activities during heavy rains. Every sub-zone will be having 4 to 5 supporting staff including the Ward Officer, who will be the contact person for that particular ward. The Ward Officer will be the first responder to all the needs from the citizens concerned and community organisers (COs) would assist the team for the next 36 to 48 hours.\nThe 13 senior officials of sub-zones will coordinate with departments like PWD, PHEO, Fire Services, District Administration, OWSSB, CESU and Water Resources Department.\nThe Commissioner also asked the PWD Team to have a response team as many secondary drains along the main roads across the city belong to the department. The PWD team will be in constant touch with the Multi-Agency Control Room at BMC. Each line department will also depute an official to the control room for better coordination.\nThe PWD and BMC teams were also asked by the Commissioner to have 15 JCBc as reserve for any emergency call to attend. Chain mounted proclain machines are also to be hired and kept reserved for any difficult situation to encounter.

BMC Commissioner Dr. Krishan Kumar convened the multi-department emergency meeting at the BMC Conference Room in the evening and briefed the senior officials to be vigilant the next 36 hours and work in tandem with the strategy and the experiences gathered from the last water-logging situations. The Municipal Commissioner also added that off day and leave of all staff of BMC and BDA remained cancelled so that better coordination would be done to face the situation in the city. The BMC and Odisha Fire Services have pre-positioned nearly 30 water pumps at vulnerable locations across the city, where the rest 22 are for the developing situation as rains have started across the city after evening hours. Both the agencies have 52 pumps (BMC 19 and Fire Services 33) pumps with them to face the situation. Meanwhile, the city has been divided into 13 sub-zones or sectors with senior officers taking their sectoral positions and in-charge of decision making activities during heavy rains. Every sub-zone will be having 4 to 5 supporting staff including the Ward Officer, who will be the contact person for that particular ward. The Ward Officer will be the first responder to all the needs from the citizens concerned and community organisers (COs) would assist the team for the next 36 to 48 hours. The 13 senior officials of sub-zones will coordinate with departments like PWD, PHEO, Fire Services, District Administration, OWSSB, CESU and Water Resources Department. The Commissioner also asked the PWD Team to have a response team as many secondary drains along the main roads across the city belong to the department. The PWD team will be in constant touch with the Multi-Agency Control Room at BMC. Each line department will also depute an official to the control room for better coordination. The PWD and BMC teams were also asked by the Commissioner to have 15 JCBc as reserve for any emergency call to attend. Chain mounted proclain machines are also to be hired and kept reserved for any difficult situation to encounter. Apart from the big machines other smaller cleaning tools will also be with the respective teams to clean the secondary and tertiary drains, in case of water-logging like situation.

The streaking meteor seen in the photo appears in Ursa Minor, a constellation in the northern sky. Victor Rogus captured this image of the Quadrantid Meteor shower in the constellation Ursa Minor at 2:39 am on Jan. 3, 2013 from Jadwin, Missouri. To take the photo, Rogus used a Carl Zeiss 35mm lens at f 2, and an ISO setting of 640, on a Cannon 60Da camera, astrophotography model. \"Battling the cold and the gibbous moon was no easy task, but I managed to catch this meteor trail in a 12-second exposure with a Cannon 60Da astrophotography camera,\" Rogus told SPACE.com via email. Veteran meteor observer John Chumack of Dayton, Ohio, set up a network of cameras to record the Quadrantid meteor shower's peak. The result was an eye-popping video of Quadrantid meteors as they streaked overhead, as well as toward the north, west and east. \"Last night the Quadrantid meteors started slamming into the Earth's atmosphere\" Chumack said in an email. \"I captured 52 Quadrantid meteors... but it's not over yet.

{"prefix": "OTTAWA \u2014 Samantha MacDougall thought her fight to get her late partner\u2019s Canada Pension Plan benefits would take years.\nThe government ended the fight for her.\nNewly approved changes to the Canada Pension Plan will mean widows and widowers, regardless of age, will receive full survivor benefits, changing five decades of federal policy.\nThe changes mean anyone under age 35 without children or a disability will receive benefits immediately, rather than having to wait to age 65, and will end benefit clawbacks for survivors under age 45.\nAnyone previously denied survivor benefits because of the age rule will be able to re-apply for benefits when the rules take effect in 2019.

Powered by a naturally-aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six from the 911 GT3 and 911 GT3 RS, the $274,500 Speedster will get individual throttle bodies which is supposed to aggressively sharpen the response of the engine\u2019s claimed 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. This car is built around a chassis \u201cderived from the 911 GT3 models with a specifically-calibrated rear axle steering system and dynamic engine mounts to deliver a maximum amount of precision, stability and driving pleasure,\u201d per a press release, and Porsche\u2019s promising a 192-mph top speed and a stopped-to-60 mph time of 3.8 seconds. Besides the obvious exterior tweaks setting the Speedster apart from any other 911\u2013those being the squat appearance thanks to its ultra-raked windshield and low rear hatch\u2013this car\u2019s been treated to extensive lightweighting. The frunk, front fenders, and rear deck lid are all \u201cmade from carbon fiber composite material\u201d while the front and rear bumpers are polyurethane. The interior door panels are lean, and the car\u2019s standard option loadout omits air conditioning, though you can spec it for free if you must. Speedster owners will also have to slum it with a cloth top that closes manually [gasp] in the name of weight savings. The six-speed manual transmission saves \u201cabout nine pounds\u201d over a Porsche seven-speed, and 40 pounds over a PDK automatic, as if you needed another excuse to go with three pedals. All those tricks are supposed to slim the Speedster\u2019s curb weight down to 3,230 pounds. So, basically, \u201ca GT3 Touring with a roof delete,\u201d as Jalopnik contributor Bradley Brownell pointed out. He also speculates the cars will be selling for half a million bucks by next summer. And, yeah, probably. 2019 Speedster owners will also be able to get an \u201cexclusive watch,\u201d sorry, timepiece, if they buy the car. It looks like the wheel of the car and the strap is apparently made of the same leather Porsche uses to make its interiors. I have no strong feelings about it one way or another. Back in 2018 Porsche teased a new sleek Speedster concept, taking design cues and a lithe aesthetic from the company\u2019s Taycan flagship. At the time, Audi designer Mike Marek said it was deliberately modeled after the brand\u2019s two flagship luxury electric vehicles, the e-tron and the i8.

It was Afghanistan's second upset in the tournament following their 91-run win over Sri Lanka which sent the islanders crashing out in the first round. Afghanistan next take on Pakistan in the double-header Super Four game in Abu Dhabi Friday while title holders India meet Bangladesh in Dubai. Afghanistan rocked the Bangladesh top four for just 43 runs before Shakib and Riyad added 36 but they were not spared by Rashid, who became the fastest bowler to 100 one-day wickets in 44 games earlier this year. This was Bangladesh's lowest total against Afghanistan by some distance \u2014 their previous lowest against the Afghans was 208 in Dhaka two years ago.

But it goes further than that.\nHis Vietnamese is so good that he has astonished the country by placing second in a national storytelling competition that is as prestigious here as the National Spelling Bee in the United States.

His parents, Bob and Kathleen Huff, moved here more than five years ago from DeQueen, Ark., to work with disabled children. With no international school in the area, they enrolled their son in a kindergarten where no English was spoken. He later spent two years in a school in Hanoi before the family moved back to Danang.\nAt first, it was hard. The other children, who had rarely seen a Westerner, liked to stare as he labored over his lessons, or to rush up and touch his skin. Then he discovered that in Vietnam, too, they play tag and hide-and-seek, and he started to make friends.\nBut Vietnamese is devilishly hard to master. Although its alphabet is Romanized, it has six distinct tones, each of which can change the meaning of a word. The tones are what give the language its singsong musicality.\nAmericans started arriving in Vietnam in the 1990s as the country sought, like China, to open up to market forces without abandoning communist one-party rule. Some, like the Huffs, came to work with children.

Companies like Nike have turned \u201cMade in Vietnam\u201d into a fixture in American malls, and Vietnam ships a lot of seafood to the U.S. market.\nToday, an estimated 2,700 Americans live in Vietnam, mostly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, which both offer international schools.

So Alex\u2019s three-story school next to an old Buddhist temple is an open-air affair with no air conditioning to keep the heat and humidity at bay.\nDanang was a base from which American warplanes took off for combat during the Vietnam War. Viet Cong guerrillas regularly rocketed the Marines\u2019 helicopter base a few miles to the south.\nNow the streets that once teemed with U.S. soldiers offer everything from Internet cafes to tour companies and clothing shops. The city of 700,000 is a constant symphony of construction noise, swarms of beeping motorbikes and people chatting or eating on the sidewalks.\nOverlooking China Beach, once a favorite for GIs on leave, is the five-star Furama Resort hotel with marble floors and tiled swimming pools.\nYet Danang maintains a small-town charm.

With no international school in the area, they enrolled their son in a kindergarten where no English was spoken. He later spent two years in a school in Hanoi before the family moved back to Danang. At first, it was hard. The other children, who had rarely seen a Westerner, liked to stare as he labored over his lessons, or to rush up and touch his skin. Then he discovered that in Vietnam, too, they play tag and hide-and-seek, and he started to make friends. But Vietnamese is devilishly hard to master. Although its alphabet is Romanized, it has six distinct tones, each of which can change the meaning of a word. The tones are what give the language its singsong musicality. Americans started arriving in Vietnam in the 1990s as the country sought, like China, to open up to market forces without abandoning communist one-party rule. Some, like the Huffs, came to work with children. Others came to do business. After signing a pact normalizing trade relations in 2001, the United States and Vietnam last year had record two-way trade totaling about $2 billion. Companies like Nike have turned \u201cMade in Vietnam\u201d into a fixture in American malls, and Vietnam ships a lot of seafood to the U.S. market. Today, an estimated 2,700 Americans live in Vietnam, mostly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, which both offer international schools. Danang in central Vietnam, 470 miles south of Hanoi, doesn\u2019t have that option. So Alex\u2019s three-story school next to an old Buddhist temple is an open-air affair with no air conditioning to keep the heat and humidity at bay. Danang was a base from which American warplanes took off for combat during the Vietnam War. Viet Cong guerrillas regularly rocketed the Marines\u2019 helicopter base a few miles to the south. Now the streets that once teemed with U.S. soldiers offer everything from Internet cafes to tour companies and clothing shops. The city of 700,000 is a constant symphony of construction noise, swarms of beeping motorbikes and people chatting or eating on the sidewalks. Overlooking China Beach, once a favorite for GIs on leave, is the five-star Furama Resort hotel with marble floors and tiled swimming pools. Yet Danang maintains a small-town charm. A typical sight is schoolgirls on bicycles wearing the traditional ao dais, a flowing white tunic. Alex says he feels most at home in Vietnam. Le Nguyen Van Anh and Alex were when they met at kindergarten. She remembers the day they met: \u201cHe was eating lunch and talking to me, and I was so amazed by his English. It was better than mine,\u201d she said. Afterward, she visited him at school to help him practice his English. Then, when her parents divorced, Alex moved back to Danang with his American friend, Sarah, who had come back from the United States.

These days, Hagee may be equally well known for his support of Israel and the Jewish people. Nearly ten years ago, Hagee founded Christian United For Israel. Today, CUFI is the largest pro-Israel organization in the world with over 2.5 million members. But without Rabbi Scheinberg, there would never have been a CUFI and nearly $100 million raised to help the people of Israel. Sitting with the pastor, the rabbi, and CUFI Communications Director Ari Morgenstern, the love and joy in the room were undeniable. Exchanging beaming smiles that lit up the room, Hagee and Scheinberg greet each other and embrace with a hug that could break a rib. The pastor and rabbi first met in 1981. At the time, Hagee approached the Jewish Federation in San Antonio about his desire to host a Night to Honor Israel. \u201cThe Jewish community was vetting me out of concerns about my agenda,\u201d Hagee explained. I asked how CUFI\u2019s work would be impacted today if Scheinberg hadn\u2019t given his blessing to Hagee\u2019s idea. \u201cThere would never have been a Night to Honor Israel or a Christians United For Israel that now has over 2.5 million members. And if we hadn\u2019t been successful in that first meeting, $95 million for humanitarian causes would never have been donated to Israel,\u201d said Hagee. After that first Night to Honor Israel, Rabbi Scheinberg began accompanying the pastor and his congregation on trips to Israel. Hagee\u2019s motives have been questioned ever since his first outreach to the Jewish community nearly ten years ago. Some critics have even claimed the pastor has taken money from Russia and China and that his true motive is to create a right-wing political mega-church in order to spread his \u201canti-gay and anti-Israel\u201d teachings. \u201cThis is false and totally inaccurate. I have nothing to do with Global Evangelism or any of the affiliated organizations, other than my relationship with Christians United For Israel and Friends of Israel. And I have no affiliation with any Russian or Chinese individual or entity in any way,\u201d he said. <sent> With that, I pressed him for further clarification. What he had said about his relationship with Russians came off as a complete lie, and that was when Scheinberg confirmed it.

Torshin didn\u2019t end up on a sanctions list until April of this year, long after the NRA distanced themselves from him. Lieu, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre in March, expressing his concern with the NRA\u2019s relationship to Torshin and noting that Torshin \u201cacted as a liaison\u201d during a December 2015 visit to Moscow by several NRA attended by board members. How deeply disturbing is it, then, that the Obama administration had made itself available to Torshin eight months earlier? Or that it allowed a potential honey-trap spy like Butina to be in the same room as a high \u201ctea party\u201d figure like Torshin, who, by the way, was also a member of the Russian parliament?

I wish that every person who\u2019s drowning under a mountain of medical debt right now could be helped by this program we\u2019ve started. But that sad reality is that with nearly one in four Americans struggling with medical bills right now, we are barely scratching the surface by paying off bills for a mere 600 of you. If there is one thing I have learned this week it\u2019s this, the current state of our nation\u2019s healthcare system is as broken as some of the dozens of people who have called to talk this week. There was James Glasscock who emailed on Tuesday. James nearly lost his sight a few years ago in an accident. He was hospitalized for a week and was eventually sent a bill for $398,999.98. How many people could afford to pay a bill like that? James went on to say that he\u2019s doing the best he can to make ends meet. Like so many others he does not qualify for Medicare coverage. Even if he did, it wouldn\u2019t erase the hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt he owes. James\u2019 wife works full time and he\u2019s started driving for Uber just so they can put food on the table. There\u2019s another common theme that\u2019s emerged this week as I\u2019ve sat here listening to your stories. All of you want to pay off these bills, but for so many different reasons you\u2019re stuck. This year alone, hundreds of thousands of you will be forced into bankruptcy because of medical debt. Most Americans say they couldn\u2019t afford to pay off a hospital bill as small as $400. And a majority of these people have insurance. But shrinking coverage and rising costs are catching people off guard when they get sick. Suddenly you find yourself drowning in debt. I\u2019ve heard stories of people who have had to sell their homes to settle medical bills. Stories of people who have tried to sell their homes to pay off medical debt but can\u2019t because their bank has placed a lien on the property, it\u2019s the sobering reality so many of you are facing. Since Tuesday, I\u2019ve listened to 78 voicemails. Ricky Eads called to talk about a logging accident he was in a few years ago. He broke all of his ribs and ended up nearly dying in the hospital. After eight days he was finally released. But now Ricky has been sent a $90,000 medical bill that he has two months to pay. And this man has insurance. So many of you have called to ask how you can qualify for our \u201cMedical Debt Rescue,\u201d program. The unfortunate answer is that you can\u2019t. But I will tell you this. Under the current system, you bear the brunt of the financial burden. And a life-changing illness or injury can force you into that cycle. This is what happens when your insurance company refuses to cover you because you don\u2019t have enough of a deductible or you\u2019ve reached your yearly deductible. Suddenly you\u2019re not considered a high enough priority, and the insurance company has no choice but to send you to collections. You\u2019re faced with paying thousands of dollars or filing for bankruptcy. Here\u2019s what Ricky has to say. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have insurance I wouldn\u2019t have a choice. But if I did, I wouldn\u2019t have to pay thousands of dollars either.\u201d <sent> But you all should not </sent>", "output": ["But I will tell you this.

Not necessarily a common Thanksgiving dish, but Harden is cooking up something special right now. Unless Lil B curses him again, Harden is going to keep stirring that pot. Most people don't get excited about DeRozan, but he's a consistent star for one of the NBA's most consistent teams. He delivers night-in, night-out even if he's not the most marketable face. And besides, his hometown of Los Angeles would love this. You're not sure how good he actually is, but as time goes on, it's hard to keep Wall out of the discussion for best players in the NBA. Brussel sprouts sound bad when you're young, but over time, you realize just how legit they are. You're not sure if you need this until when you read this. Shrimp are prone to overcooking in all that butter and cream, which is why you might be turned off by them. They also know how to find the right spot in the oven and cook up to a medium-rare center.

{"prefix": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Matthew G. Whitaker, the nation\u2019s new acting attorney general, repeatedly chided presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in public statements during 2016 while he was speaking for a group that is barred by its tax-exempt status from supporting or opposing political candidates during a campaign.\nBefore coming to the Justice Department in 2017, Whitaker was president and executive or of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a charitable organization that styles itself as nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group \u2014 known by its initials, FACT \u2014 is supposed to serve the public interest under Section 501c3 of the U.S. tax code, without directly or even indirectly supporting or opposing specific candidates for office.\nYet the group has engaged in one partisan pronouncement after another, mostly directed at Democrats. During the last presidential race, Whitaker argued in July 2016 newspaper opinion pieces that Clinton should be prosecuted for her handling of her private email server \u2014 a favourite talking point of Donald Trump. The opinion pieces identified Whitaker as FACT\u2019s leader.\nIn September 2016, Whitaker argued that Clinton had acted shamelessly by appointing her charity\u2019s donors to boards of the State Department when she was secretary of state.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the history of our country that served in the administration has been this bold in their private fundraising and their sort of giving favours,\u201d he said in a radio interview posted on YouTube by his group.\nDaniel Borochoff, president of CharityWatch, a Chicago-based group that monitors the non-profit world, said that statement appears to violate the IRS ban on engagement for or against a particular political candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s highly critical of a candidate, and he ought not to be doing that, because it\u2019s a political partisan comment,\u201d he said.\nWhitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, left FACT in October 2017 to become Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 chief of staff. He was named this week by President Trump to take over at least temporarily for Sessions, who resigned at Trump\u2019s request.\nIn 2015 and 2016, Whitaker earned a total of $654,000 from FACT \u2014 30 per cent of its entire spending of $2.2 million over that two-year span. His 2016 salary was $402,000; the average CEO or executive director at 380 advocacy or education charities in that year made a salary of $173,099, according to Matthew J. Viola, a vice-president at Charity Navigator.\nBorochoff suggested that Whitaker\u2019s board of directors at FACT didn\u2019t appear to be independent enough to apply the brakes on his campaign partisanship. Whitaker appeared to exert tight control over a three-person board of directors that included just one unsalaried member, according to the group\u2019s IRS filings in 2015-16.\nWhitaker\u2019s foundation was initially formed and", "gen_completion": " registered in 2005 by Harold Ickes, who would become Trump\u2019s first ethics lawyer, and Michael Vellounis, who would go on to become director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics under the Obama administration in 2013. A FACT executive, Robert Barnett, also served as its president.

Whitaker, the nation\u2019s new acting attorney general, repeatedly chided presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in public statements during 2016 while he was speaking for a group that is barred by its tax-exempt status from supporting or opposing political candidates during a campaign. Before coming to the Justice Department in 2017, Whitaker was president and executive or of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a charitable organization that styles itself as nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group \u2014 known by its initials, FACT \u2014 is supposed to serve the public interest under Section 501c3 of the U.S. tax code, without directly or even indirectly supporting or opposing specific candidates for office. Yet the group has engaged in one partisan pronouncement after another, mostly directed at Democrats. During the last presidential race, Whitaker argued in July 2016 newspaper opinion pieces that Clinton should be prosecuted for her handling of her private email server \u2014 a favourite talking point of Donald Trump. The opinion pieces identified Whitaker as FACT\u2019s leader. In September 2016, Whitaker argued that Clinton had acted shamelessly by appointing her charity\u2019s donors to boards of the State Department when she was secretary of state. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the history of our country that served in the administration has been this bold in their private fundraising and their sort of giving favours,\u201d he said in a radio interview posted on YouTube by his group. Daniel Borochoff, president of CharityWatch, a Chicago-based group that monitors the non-profit world, said that statement appears to violate the IRS ban on engagement for or against a particular political candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s highly critical of a candidate, and he ought not to be doing that, because it\u2019s a political partisan comment,\u201d he said. Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, left FACT in October 2017 to become Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 chief of staff. He was named this week by President Trump to take over at least temporarily for Sessions, who resigned at Trump\u2019s request. In 2015 and 2016, Whitaker earned a total of $654,000 from FACT \u2014 30 per cent of its entire spending of $2.2 million over that two-year span. His 2016 salary was $402,000; the average CEO or executive director at 380 advocacy or education charities in that year made a salary of $173,099, according to Matthew J. Viola, a vice-president at Charity Navigator. Borochoff suggested that Whitaker\u2019s board of directors at FACT didn\u2019t appear to be independent enough to apply the brakes on his campaign partisanship. Whitaker appeared to exert tight control over a three-person board of directors that included just one unsalaried member, according to the group\u2019s IRS filings in 2015-16. Whitaker\u2019s foundation was initially formed and in 2005 by two lobbyists, Harold Ickes, who was to become Trump\u2019s chief ethics counsel, and Michael Vellonis, who would become director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in the Obama administration in 2013.

Drudge Report said the operation would take place on Friday in New York.\nJagger himself tweeted that he was \"devastated\" to delay the tour of 17 shows in the US and Canada that were due to start later this month and run until June.\n\"I will be working very hard to be back on stage as soon as I can,\" he added. \"I really hate letting you down like this.\"\nDoctors said that if the surgery goes well, Jagger could be back on his feet relatively rapidly.\nHeart surgeon and US television presenter Dr Mehmet Oz said \"about about 10 percent of people at his age have problem with their aortic valve which can lead to chest pain and dizziness.\n\"About 50 percent of people who have the problem will die in a couple of years if they don't have the surgery,\" he added in a video posted on Twitter.\nHe said traditionally the operation has been done with open heart surgery but \"new techniques allow us to do these procedures with minimal invasion with a catheter (tube). You can sneak your way up there and replace the old value with a new one.\n\"This allows the person to be back home in a day or two.

The iconic British band put back the North American leg of their \"No Filter\" tour Saturday saying the 75-year-old rocker was to receive unspecified medical treatment. There has been no official information about the veteran frontman's condition other than the group's declaration on Twitter that \"Mick has been advised by doctors that he cannot go on tour as he needs medical treatment.\" With fans taking to social media to say they were praying for Jagger, the band tried to dampen fears by adding that \"Mick is expected to make a complete recovery so that he can get back on stage as soon as possible.\" Rolling Stone magazine reported Monday that the singer is to have heart valve surgery. Drudge Report said the operation would take place on Friday in New York. Jagger himself tweeted that he was \"devastated\" to delay the tour of 17 shows in the US and Canada that were due to start later this month and run until June. \"I will be working very hard to be back on stage as soon as I can,\" he added. \"I really hate letting you down like this.\" Doctors said that if the surgery goes well, Jagger could be back on his feet relatively rapidly. Heart surgeon and US television presenter Dr Mehmet Oz said \"about about 10 percent of people at his age have problem with their aortic valve which can lead to chest pain and dizziness. \"About 50 percent of people who have the problem will die in a couple of years if they don't have the surgery,\" he added in a video posted on Twitter. He said traditionally the operation has been done with open heart surgery but \"new techniques allow us to do these procedures with minimal invasion with a catheter (tube). You can sneak your way up there and replace the old value with a new one. \"This allows the person to be back home in a day or two.

He said the procedures to repair or replace it were similar. Heart valve problems had until recent years meant serious open heart surgery for most people in their seventies and eighties.

The good news is we have performed well for four years, so we know who we are. We know what we're about. We know this team well, we know the Spurs well, so we know what we have to do. We've got to go do it. The last month is meaningless now. Everything starts over.\" Some of that is what Kerr gained from Spurs coach Gregg Popovich: \"You take whatever is in front of you and you embrace it.\" Kerr hardly played during four seasons with San Antonio late in his career. Still, Popovich is one of his favorite people \u2014 even if he wants nothing more than to eliminate his dear friend. \"Pop doesn't like to see me lose. I like to see him lose. He's had way too much success already,\" Kerr cracked. \"I think sometimes Pop needs to be humbled a little bit. So I'm looking to really rub it in and enjoy if we're able to beat them.\" Kerr added: \"I want Pop to win against anybody else. We're that close. He's my mentor and he's somebody I feel incredibly strongly about in terms of who he is and what he did for me in my life, and what he's doing for my son right now.\" Golden State has gone without Curry for 16 of the last 17 games as he worked back from another injury to his troublesome right ankle only to sprain the medial collateral ligament in his left knee in his return March 23. Curry is scheduled to be re-evaluated Saturday yet Kerr noted that \"he's not close to playing.\" The Warriors also aren't expecting to see Spurs star Kawhi Leonard. He played in only nine regular-season games because of a lingering right quadriceps injury. Durant and Green insist it's time to start taking defense more seriously. \"Now we can focus in on what we always do good here, it's flying around on defense, moving the basketball,\" Durant said. The Spurs realize the challenges. \"They are smart, they are long,\" Manu Ginobili said. \"They are very quick to switch back to the matchups they want. They've got a lot of long wings that recover very quick.... There's a reason why Golden State is what it is and Cleveland isn't, and I'm hoping we can capitalize on that and learn a few things about them.\" Asked about the rumor that the Warriors will use a three-guard system, Popovich declined to comment. \"He just has to believe in himself,\" Kerr said. \"Believe in himself and have confidence in what he's doing. \" <sent> He's a terrific coach and has gotten better, so hopefully he trusts his instincts in how to make this happen for himself and feel good about it, but he's a smart enough player if he just wanted it badly enough to work </sent>", "output": ["Golden State is what it is and Cleveland isn't, and I'm hoping we can capitalize on that and learn a few things about them.\" Asked about the rumor that the Warriors will use a three-guard system, Popovich declined to comment. \"He just has to believe in himself,\" Kerr said. \"Believe in himself and have confidence in what he's doing. \" He's a great coach and he's gotten even better.

Under a landmark deal signed in November between Iran and world powers - known as the P5+1 - that came into effect in January of this year, Iran's exports are supposed to be held at an average 1 million bpd for the six months to July 20. Tough international sanctions over the past two years have cut Iran's oil exports around a half. \"The question is whether they are going to continue to test the sanctions,\" Antoine Halff, head of the IEA's oil industry and markets division, told Reuters. China accounted for 168,000 bpd of the rise in imports in February, India for 93,000 bpd and South Korea for 83,000 bpd. On the other hand, Japanese imports of Iranian oil were revised lower by 103,000 bpd, according to the IEA. \"Imports of Iranian oil are running well above 2013 levels for the third consecutive month,\" the report said.

Nichols got things started with a 29-yard touch pass over the Kingsway defense to Carlton Lawrence for the game's opening score. The Camden Catholic transfer then hit Clayton Scott on a 45-yard touchdown pass to make it a 14-0 Bolts lead early in the first quarter. \"It's been a long wait, but I was ready for it,\" Nichols said. \"It felt good, good to throw that first touchdown.\" Tristan Harris, last week's starting quarterback, also tossed a pair of touchdowns in the win over Kingsway. The plan moving forward is for Harris and Nichols to share signal-calling duties. Harris connected with Marical Ramos on a 4-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter before finding Lawrence in the third on a 63-yard catch and run. Lawrence isn't concerned about Nichols and Harris coexisting. \"They love each other, their bond is crazy,\" Lawrence said. Scott was his usual dynamic self again for Millville (2-0). Aside from his touchdown catch, the senior ripped off second-quarter scoring runs of 41 and 16 yards, respectively. Scott finished with 121 yards on 16 carries. It's off to rival St. Augustine next week for Millville in what figures to be the Bolts' biggest test of the young season. The Hermits were 45-7 winners over Williamstown on Friday. \"Coach said don't even think about the Prep, just keep your mindset on this game,\" Lawrence said. \"Don't worry about the Prep, we got them next week, just finish this game then we'll deal with them.\" Thomas, when asked, quickly shrugged of the notion that Kingsway could have been a trap game for Millville. \"We're just taking it one game at a time,\" Thomas said. The most crucial point of the night came on the first possession of the game. On third-and-13 from the Kingsway 33, Nichols lofted a pass that was caught in the end zone by senior Patrick Condon. The catch put Millville in the red zone and the rest was history. \"It was an easy decision for me. I wanted to get it to Patrick (because he's the only one who can catch it in the end zone),\" said Nichols, who had to settle for a field goal to make it 14-0 in the first quarter.

The 4-year-old law is the latest version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\nThe guidance allows a school with at least 40 percent of its students determined to be low-income to operate a schoolwide program, as opposed to a targeted program. A targeted program seeks to identify and specifically serve low-income students.\nTo create a schoolwide program, a school must redesign its entire educational program to serve all students, the guidance says.

{"prefix": "A ban addressing the controversial practice of gay conversion therapy has passed through its first House committee.\nMedical students James Pathoulas and Kevin O'Donnell pose for a portrait on Feb. 22 on campus. The two are part of an effort to ban conversion therapy in Minnesota.\nThe proposed legislation written by Rep. Hunter Cantrell, DFL-Savage, passed through the Health and Human Services Policy Committee earlier this month. It requires licensed counselors and therapists to outline that conversion therapy is deemed ineffective by major medical organizations. The ban does not apply to pastoral counseling.\nNearly all major medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and American Psychological Association, have denounced conversion therapy, stating it is not grounded in scientific reasoning and can be detrimental to patients.\nCiting the important intersection of medicine and policy, University of Minnesota Medical School students James Pathoulas and Kevin O'Donnell voiced support for the ban.\n\u201cThis bill is really about protecting people, especially vulnerable people from a fraudulent practice,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\nPathoulas said exact statistics about the use of conversion therapy in Minnesota are unavailable because of \u201ccoded language,\u201d such as \u201crestorative therapy\u201d or \u201creligious counseling.\" A 2018 University of California-Los Angeles' Williams Institute study estimated 689,000 LGBTQ adults have received conversion therapy nationally, and an estimated 57,000 LGBTQ individuals will receive conversion therapy before the age of 18.\nOne of the most adamant supporters of this legislation has been OutFront Minnesota, an LGBTQ advocacy organization. Emma McBride, who works in policy and legislative affairs with the organization, said the bill does not infringe on religious freedoms.\n\u201cThe second part of the bill actually says you can\u2019t falsely advertise goods or services. We already have that law written for a good reason \u2014 to protect consumers and vulnerable Minnesotans \u2014 and we\u2019re just saying that that needs to apply to conversion therapy as well,\u201d McBride said.\nThe bill\u2019s critics say otherwise.

Medical students James Pathoulas and Kevin O'Donnell pose for a portrait on Feb. 22 on campus. The two are part of an effort to ban conversion therapy in Minnesota. The proposed legislation written by Rep. Hunter Cantrell, DFL-Savage, passed through the Health and Human Services Policy Committee earlier this month. It requires licensed counselors and therapists to outline that conversion therapy is deemed ineffective by major medical organizations. The ban does not apply to pastoral counseling. Nearly all major medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and American Psychological Association, have denounced conversion therapy, stating it is not grounded in scientific reasoning and can be detrimental to patients. Citing the important intersection of medicine and policy, University of Minnesota Medical School students James Pathoulas and Kevin O'Donnell voiced support for the ban. \u201cThis bill is really about protecting people, especially vulnerable people from a fraudulent practice,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. Pathoulas said exact statistics about the use of conversion therapy in Minnesota are unavailable because of \u201ccoded language,\u201d such as \u201crestorative therapy\u201d or \u201creligious counseling.\" A 2018 University of California-Los Angeles' Williams Institute study estimated 689,000 LGBTQ adults have received conversion therapy nationally, and an estimated 57,000 LGBTQ individuals will receive conversion therapy before the age of 18. One of the most adamant supporters of this legislation has been OutFront Minnesota, an LGBTQ advocacy organization. Emma McBride, who works in policy and legislative affairs with the organization, said the bill does not infringe on religious freedoms. \u201cThe second part of the bill actually says you can\u2019t falsely advertise goods or services. We already have that law written for a good reason \u2014 to protect consumers and vulnerable Minnesotans \u2014 and we\u2019re just saying that that needs to apply to conversion therapy as well,\u201d McBride said. The bill\u2019s critics say otherwise. Conservative and religious advocacy organizations, like Transform Minnesota and the Minnesota Family Council, say the bill infringes on religious freedoms.

{"prefix": "New Delhi: The stage is set for the Narendra Modi government to present its final budget before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, with the government finalizing the dates of the budget session\u2014the last sitting of the 16th Lok Sabha. The budget session is likely to run from 31 January to 13 February. Finance minister Arun Jaitley will present an interim budget on 1 February.\nAccording to convention, the finance minister does not announce any new programmes that could give the government an electoral advantage and impose a financial burden beyond the initial four months of the fiscal. But nothing prevents the government from using the opportunity to present an economic road map for the next five years.\nThe rules are not cast in stone: P. Chidambaram, while presenting the interim budget for 2014-15 ahead of the last Lok Sabha elections, had announced the One Rank One Pension scheme for the armed forces in a move that could win the support of voters in the defence services. Jaitley later criticized Chidambaram for providing only \u20b9 500 crore in his interim budget, which was a pittance compared to the annual financial implication of the scheme at around \u20b9 7,500 crore.\nThis time around, in a poll of 40,000 people conducted by citizen engagement platform LocalCircles on its social media platform, 64% of respondents said they wanted the government to include tax measures in the budget, while 71% said they were against the government announcing a farm loan waiver.\nThe policy initiatives that the government could take in the interim budget were limited as direct tax adjustments would require amending the finance bill, said D.K.

The budget session is likely to run from 31 January to 13 February. Finance minister Arun Jaitley will present an interim budget on 1 February. According to convention, the finance minister does not announce any new programmes that could give the government an electoral advantage and impose a financial burden beyond the initial four months of the fiscal. But nothing prevents the government from using the opportunity to present an economic road map for the next five years. The rules are not cast in stone: P. Chidambaram, while presenting the interim budget for 2014-15 ahead of the last Lok Sabha elections, had announced the One Rank One Pension scheme for the armed forces in a move that could win the support of voters in the defence services. Jaitley later criticized Chidambaram for providing only \u20b9 500 crore in his interim budget, which was a pittance compared to the annual financial implication of the scheme at around \u20b9 7,500 crore. This time around, in a poll of 40,000 people conducted by citizen engagement platform LocalCircles on its social media platform, 64% of respondents said they wanted the government to include tax measures in the budget, while 71% said they were against the government announcing a farm loan waiver. The policy initiatives that the government could take in the interim budget were limited as direct tax adjustments would require amending the finance bill, said D.K.

Paramount is releasing the film in the exact same corridor that brought success in the last couple of years to two other, somewhat similar movies American Sniper and Lone Survivor, and like the latter film in particular, Bay has crafted a patriotic, riveting war movie full of intense action that also thankfully puts a human face on exactly what happened in Benghazi.\nretired Navy Seals and Marines now in their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, is basically a movie that puts its emphasis on the brave men who fought this battle rather than the ensuing political storm it is still causing as we enter this Presidential election year. Hillary Clinton and President Obama (not even mentioned) are not the focus here as in the political debate about what was done \u2013 or not done- in this incident. Rather, it is these six men who form a unit called Group Global Response or GGR there, to protect and provide security for whatever problems might come up. When U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens (Matt Letscher) goes out to visit the vulnerable outpost, a terrorist attack soon follows and he is killed, a victim of smoke inhalation, along with three others. With no American military in sight, the GGR tries to ride to the rescue but are thwarted by a superior named Bob ( David Costabile) and lose crucial time. Against his orders they go anyway. When they get there the place is in flames and the CIA Annex is likely the next target. What ensues is a very violent war film full of shooting and explosions, exactly the kind of thing we have come to expect from Bay films, but here in the context of a true story seems all too real, putting the audience right in the center of the action.\nIn many ways this movie, which really only wants to focus on the warrior, not the war, is like many others, but because it is likely to be used as a political football (and already has been on Fox News) the real point of it could be sadly lost. I hope it isn\u2019t because seeing this whole thing from the POV of the men who were on the front lines, much like The Alamo in some ways (there\u2019s even a reference to that), is compelling moviemaking and a real step forward into something a little more important than another Transformers movie for Bay.\nThe acting across the board is excellent with standouts being John Krasinski as a former Navy Seal who must abandon his family just one more time to take on an assignment he thought would be brief and uneventful.

If there is criticism about Howard it\u2019s that sometimes he isn\u2019t exactly very funny but if the movie can manage to avoid too many of those I\u2019ll be fine with it, because it is at its heart very serious business in which someone has to sacrifice very nearly everything to their family, especially their wife and children for the greater good.

Khan, who was named by Jalan during questioning, recorded his statement on Saturday. He said that no money changed hands and whenever he lost, Jalan blackmailed him to appear at public events, said inspector Sharma. Khan is likely to be made a witness in the case. Actor Arbaaz Khan arrived at the anti-extortion cell office around 11am. He was at the office for nearly five hours. Jalan and Khan were brought face to face, said Sharma. The inspector told TOI that Khan had confessed to having placed the bets through Jalan, who was introduced to him by a common friend seven years ago. \u201cEarlier, Khan placed small bets just for fun and there was no monetary transaction between him and Jalan,\u201d said an officer from the department. Police said Khan has told them that Jalan never showed him any accounts and would give him special treatment. \u201cThough Jalan kept records of Khan\u2019s wins and losses, no money changed hands. It was only after a spate of losses that there was an argument between the actor and Jalan.

The Brain Trauma Indicator measures blood plasma levels of the UCH-L1, a protein scientists believe helps dispose of cellular waste in the brain, and GFAP, a structural protein found in non-neuronal cells called astrocytes. Both are released at elevated levels following a concussion or other injury that damages nerve fibers, and both can be detected within 20 minutes of a head injury (although it may take longer for doctors and patients to get the results from a lab). Concussions are notoriously difficult to diagnose, and patients suspected of having them are typically assessed by a doctor using the Glasgow Coma Scale\u2014a series of physical tests for determining the level of consciousness\u2014followed by a computed tomography (CT) head scan for brain abnormalities. CT scans are expensive, however, and many patients suspected of having concussions are not scanned, according to the FDA.

The doctor-entrepreneur-vintner, best known for inventing the angioplasty balloon, runs the Thomas Fogarty Winery just a few miles uphill from his medtech incubator at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View.\nThe non-profit Fogarty Institute for Innovation is based around a simple concept: Making life easier for small or early stage medtech firms developing cutting-edge products or tools. In an interview with Fast Company, Fogarty decried what he saw as the increasing cost of American medical innovation, and said that small medical companies need a safe environment for growth similar to those of lower-overhead conventional tech startups.\nSince its founding in 2007, the Institute has helped about a dozen small medical companies launch. Back in June, the Institute announced its latest crop of participants. The five new companies are primarily centered around providing services for expectant parents or newborn children. Among them are a non-invasive sensor that records fetal vital signs, a device that prevents vaginal tearing during childbirth, and a sensor set for clinicians giving urgent care to newborns.\nFirst Pulse Medical: First Pulse manufactures one of the first attempts at a heart rate monitor for fetuses during labor and delivery. The monitor uses proprietary light sensors to track a fetus's heart rate and oxygenation.\nInPress Technologies: InPress is testing a single-use medical device which quickly and effectively treats postpartum hemorrhaging (PPH) as it happens by stimulating vaginal contractions. One woman dies from PPH every four minutes.\nMaterna Medical: Materna is conducting tests in Australia on an anti-vaginal tearing device for women giving birth. The mechanical dilator is inserted during the first stage of labor and is designed to prevent vaginal tearing or pelvic damage during childbirth.\nMedical Cue: Medical Cue's NeoCue system is a combination sensor set/workflow organizing tool for childbirth. The system automatically gives medical professionals key physiologic data and real-time decision guidance.\nPrescient Surgical: Prescient Surgical's Cleancision device prevents dangerous surgical wound infections.

Not every 79-year-old surgeon who runs a tech incubator happens to have a winery either. But Thomas Fogarty does. The doctor-entrepreneur-vintner, best known for inventing the angioplasty balloon, runs the Thomas Fogarty Winery just a few miles uphill from his medtech incubator at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View. The non-profit Fogarty Institute for Innovation is based around a simple concept: Making life easier for small or early stage medtech firms developing cutting-edge products or tools. In an interview with Fast Company, Fogarty decried what he saw as the increasing cost of American medical innovation, and said that small medical companies need a safe environment for growth similar to those of lower-overhead conventional tech startups. Since its founding in 2007, the Institute has helped about a dozen small medical companies launch. Back in June, the Institute announced its latest crop of participants. The five new companies are primarily centered around providing services for expectant parents or newborn children. Among them are a non-invasive sensor that records fetal vital signs, a device that prevents vaginal tearing during childbirth, and a sensor set for clinicians giving urgent care to newborns. First Pulse Medical: First Pulse manufactures one of the first attempts at a heart rate monitor for fetuses during labor and delivery. The monitor uses proprietary light sensors to track a fetus's heart rate and oxygenation. InPress Technologies: InPress is testing a single-use medical device which quickly and effectively treats postpartum hemorrhaging (PPH) as it happens by stimulating vaginal contractions. One woman dies from PPH every four minutes. Materna Medical: Materna is conducting tests in Australia on an anti-vaginal tearing device for women giving birth. The mechanical dilator is inserted during the first stage of labor and is designed to prevent vaginal tearing or pelvic damage during childbirth. Medical Cue: Medical Cue's NeoCue system is a combination sensor set/workflow organizing tool for childbirth. The system automatically gives medical professionals key physiologic data and real-time decision guidance. Prescient Surgical: Prescient Surgical's Cleancision device prevents dangerous surgical wound infections. This Stanford University spin-off is targeting a very specific market--obese patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

One such dispersal order was put in place following the stabbing of a 15-year-old boy in the city centre on Sunday, February 2. This meant officers could move on any groups hanging around in the city centre if it\u2019s suspected they could be a crime or anti-social behaviour threat. If those moved along came back, then they faced possibly being arrested. Coventry stabbing reaction: \"Where are the parents?\" The teenager was found with knife injuries to his leg and lower torso in Trinity Street shortly before 6pm and was taken to hospital. His injuries were not life-changing and he was released from hospital just hours later. Dispersal orders are not a new action that police can take, however they aren&apos;t always used. So we asked the Commander of Coventry Police, Chief Superintendent Mike O&apos;Hara, why one was used on Sunday and what came of it. Q: Why was this stabbing deemed serious enough to put the dispersal order in place? A: The stabbing was deemed serious enough by the duty Inspector on the evening to put the order in place, due to the fact that groups were congregating in the area. The groups soon dispersed following increased police presence in the area. Q: Was the order actually used by officers on Sunday or Monday to move anyone along or did it result in any arrests? A: I cannot confirm at this stage the specific details of the use of the order, however, previous use of the dispersal power has proven very effective in removing problematic individuals from the city centre and preventing potential issues. Officers have utilised search powers on numerous individuals in the area resulting in a drugs arrest. Q: Is the use of dispersal orders something you are now considering using more often in the wake of incidents like this? A: The use of the dispersal power is a very useful tool for officers in dealing with groups of youths when they feel that the criteria apply and the St Michaels or St George\u2019s area is considered to be unsafe, or that a large group of youths may cause problems, or are causing anti-social behaviour. Q: Have you ever used it with groups before, and what was their reaction?

President Sue Decker said Yahoo is focusing on innovating in search technology, as opposed to trying to replicate the current models, because the company believes the search experience can be greatly improved. For the third quarter, Yahoo expects revenue in the range of $1.78 billion - $1.83 billion, a decline of 7 percent to 13 percent over the same period last year. It expects to post a loss per share of five to 15 cents, which will narrow to a range of three to 23 cents in the fourth quarter.

Utah businesses will now be required to provide sufficient time during the workday for mothers to breast feed and take care of pregnancy-related matters. Senate Bill 59, signed by Gov. Gary Herbert on March 28, mandates employers with 15 or more employees provide accommodations for workers who are pregnant, breastfeeding or in \"any related condition.\" Through this new anti-discriminatory law, employers for at least one year must provide a reasonable amount of time for breaks when employees need to breastfeed or express milk. The law does not make it a requirement for businesses to permit employees to bring their children to work to accommodate pregnancy or breastfeeding needs. According to the bill\u2019s sponsor, Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods, employers can ask for a doctor\u2019s note to avoid any pregnancy-related guessing. Weiler said for 25 years the U.S. has already set up similar standards for disabled employees under the Americans with Disabilities Act. This law puts into place provisions for businesses to allow employees with disabilities to fully participate in their work environment by making needed accommodations, which could include larger computer monitors or wider desks to fit a wheelchair. House Bill 105 was passed in 2015, which modified the Utah Antidiscrimination Act by addressing breastfeeding and medical conditions related to breastfeeding. According to a 2014 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 40.7 percent of mothers were still breastfeeding when their child was at 12 months.

The Web has replaced the stage outside the covered wagon as the venue of choice, but the issues are still very relevant as word-of-mouth marketing and testimonials remain effective promotional strategies. So, when is the line between creative publicity tactics and deceptive practices crossed? The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has maintained its Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising for decades. In 2009, the FTC updated the guides to, among other things, specifically address the use of testimonials in blogs, social media, and other online outlets. It's a fairly simple premise - where there is a material connection between the speaker and brand that the audience would not other-wise reasonably infer, a disclosure is needed. One of the FTC's first enforcement actions after the new guides were issued was against a PR firm. Reverb Communications had hyped the products of its video-game clients by posting glowing reviews in the iTunes store without disclosing it was paid to promote those games. It was clearly a deceptive practice. The same disclosure issues can arise in many different campaigns, whether in comments on a blog, threads on a social media site, product placement deals, even coordinated efforts between journalists and marketers. PR pros when it comes to testimonials are pretty good at spotting marketers and publishers engaged in pay-to-play tactics or other unfair practices that could drive consumers away. But this approach may miss issues where there is no direct link between the speaker and the audience. If a journalist met or interviewed a blogger who then posted paid reviews of a movie that was just out on DVD, for example, the journalist could reasonably expect that the film would get a slightly more favorable review. Consequently, the journalist might reasonably expect that the film would not be as good as he or she had hoped. Such an expectation wouldn't be all that unusual for the average reader.

Week 4 of the Fort Frances Stewardship Youth Ranger-Ogimaa Binesiiyog Partnership Program has the rangers keeping busy around town, and then off to Caliper Lake Provincial Park for more clearing, cleaning, camping and canoeing. Back in April, I had the honour of attending the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York City, alongside several of my colleagues. This was the 16th-annual conference at the UN dedicated exclusively to discussing the issues facing the world\u2019s indigenous populations. The forum brought the world together on the 10th anniversary of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, or UNDRIP. As we embark on a new year, it\u2019s important to take time to focus on what the future holds for our communities in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding and our country as a whole. When we consider the future, our youth always must be a priority as they will inherit the outcome of any decisions our current leadership makes. The youth of today are engaged in a way we\u2019ve never seen before. According to a study by Abacus Data and the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, youth turnout jumped by 12 percentage points between the 2011 and 2015 elections. In July of this year, in a speech by U.S. Congressman Trey Gowdy to the students of Liberty University, Gowdy shared two questions he posed to those employed at his office. The first question was which do you value more: truth or freedom? Everyone present answered they valued freedom more than truth. The second question was which do you value more: unity or diversity? Everyone except one answered they valued diversity more than unity. Oct. 19 marked one full year that I have had the honour and privilege of representing the people of Thunder Bay-Rainy River in Parliament. I am proud of the \u201cReal Change\u201d I promised in my first speech to Parliament. In March, our government committed to restoring funding to post-secondary education. In April, the Parliamentary Budget Officer estimated that the Liberals\u2019 investment in post-secondary education would yield a net return to the economy of $3.1 billion by the year 2020, adjusting for inflation. In May, the government committed to investing $12.7 billion over six years in our post-secondary institutions, beginning in the academic year 2019-2020, to help young Canadians attend and complete university, college or university-level training programs, and to help those in financial need pay for their education. When the NDP came to power in 2015, I was concerned they would focus on what they could control: health care, education and the environment.

US gold futures for December also touched a low since August 9 at $1,304.60 an ounce and stood at $1313.50,still down $17.40. \"This is almost certainly the pricing in of the expectations of QE tapering,\" Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said. \"The FOMC is meeting next week and there is a great deal of speculation over the beginning of the end as far as QE is concerned as soon as the end of the month of whatever size that might be,\" he added. The US Federal Reserve may announce a cut in its $85 billion monthly bond purchases at the end of its two-day meeting on Sept. 18. Gold lost 19 percent this year after the Fed signalled it would start reining in nearly five years of quantitative easing that weighed the dollar down and encouraged investors to buy hard and non-interest rate bearing assets like gold. Gold were under pressure from a firmer dollar ahead of US retail sales and sentiment data due later on Friday, which could further weigh on sentiment if they come in above market expectations. Gold prices rallied above $1,430 an ounce to a three-and-a-half-month high in late August on safe-haven buying as the United States and its allies looked set to launch military strikes on Syria. But the metal's appeal has been dented by diplomatic efforts to place Syria's chemical weapons under international control,which may avert a US military strike.Physical dealers reported gold buying in the underlying market, but demand was tepid.
