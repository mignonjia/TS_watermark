It ranked the top applicants with post-Alice allowance withdrawals. Unsurprisingly IBM, eBay and Microsoft were the top three assignees, named in 47, 19 and 15 applications respectively. Perhaps more surprisingly, gaming companies IGT and WMS Gaming are in the top 10.

A fee was paid for the first The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes but Klinger refused to pay a licence fee for the second installment.\nIn June, the Seventh Circuit ruled that the copyright on 46 stories and four novels featuring Holmes were in the public domain.

{"prefix": "The Seven Cs of Political Leadership!\nAs I sit down on the eve of my 40th birthday to write this editorial, I couldn't have thought of writing on a more important aspect -- as great political leadership is what India requires more than anything else today.\nAs I sit down on the eve of my 40th birthday to write this editorial, I couldn't have thought of writing on a more important aspect -- as great political leadership is what India requires more than anything else today. And though I have written considerably on leadership, it has mainly been about corporate leadership.\nLeadership in corporations is massively different from political leadership, and therefore it requires a special model and a special line of thinking. While in corporations the final aim is profit maximisation in most cases, in politics the final objective is necessarily social welfare maximisation.\nWhile in corporations the best leaders are often the best marketing guys, in politics the best leaders necessarily have to be the people who are the sincerest and most hard working. While in business you can make do without the knowledge of economics, in politics that can be suicidal. While in business being unethical can harm you and at most your stake holders, in politics the lack of ethics ruins an entire nation's future.\nAnd most importantly, while in corporations leadership is about commitment to the strongest and survival of the fittest, in political leadership, the focus always is about commitment to the weakest and survival of the weakest. Thus, for me, political leadership is not just about having certain qualities but also simultaneously about not having various qualities. Rather, what is important is to ensure that one does not possess certain specific qualities first; if that is taken care of, the rest would then automatically fall in place.\nKeeping all the above in mind, I believe the model of the seven winning virtues of political leadership (viz credibility, compassion, clairvoyance, camaraderie, commitment, charisma and competence) that I have developed is most suited for Indian politicians in particular.\nWell, the difference in this model and any other such model is that in this model, each element or virtue is actually the opposite of one of the seven sins of life -- the seven deadly sins that we are supposed to avoid; to a large extent, as normal human beings and to an almost extreme extent, as a political leader! The first sin that a leader must avoid is that of greed. This is what seems to be the biggest problem with political leaders in India. The reason behind all the lack of development in India at the cost", "gen_completion": " of the poor is that as a country we are in a culture of self-gratification, where people are not satisfied even if all the material comforts that they have are taken away from them. But when such material possessions are taken away, their self-gratification wanes dramatically and thus political leaders can get away with such self-gratification for some time. But when such material possessions are not restored after they are taken away, leaders tend to keep being corrupt rather than become better or work for more effective government, because that would obviously defeat the whole idea of self-gratification.\nThe important thing is that the next virtue of leaders in a complex organisation (politics) should not be that they should not lie and cheat anyone and thus they must have more humility. It should really be that they must not be conceited to the extent so that they do not impose their views on others. Once they have realised that the whole country should have a common goal, they"}
{"prefix": "When it comes to safety in the workplace, organizational culture can be quite literally a matter of life and death. Look no further than the example of BP.\nAs one of the world's largest oil producers, BP has a troubled safety record. As Forbes reports, one of BP's plants has an unusually tragic past, including an explosion in 2005 that killed 15 workers and injured 180. This plant also reported 23 worker fatalities in the three decades that preceded the 2005 accident.\nWhen Marathon Petroleum, the fourth-largest oil refiner in the U.S., bought the plant from BP, many in the industry thought it was a risky move. But Marathon had ideas for how to rectify the situation by instituting a culture centered on safety.\nRemedying the culture required a review of the plant's existing safety procedures. Following the 2005 explosion, federal investigators pointed to BP's problematic safety culture -- for example, with managers who were \"checking off boxes\" rather than promoting best practices for safety -- as the cause of the plant's many safety problems. BP failed to respond and paid dearly for its inaction in 2010, when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, killing 11 and spilling more than 3 million barrels of oil. The incident cost the company $54 billion in damages.\nAs BP's record illustrates, organizational culture matters a great deal to employee safety. Cultures in which employees are engaged in their work are safer places to work. Gallup's 2016 meta-analysis study -- which examined more than 82,000 business units and 1.8 million employees in 230 organizations, across 49 industries and in 73 countries -- shows that business units with engagement scores in the top quartile of Gallup's employee engagement database have 70% fewer safety incidents compared with bottom-quartile units.\nTheir employees are committed to doing quality work. When workers are committed to a standard of excellence in all they do, it's natural for them to adhere to best practices that prevent safety incidents. When employees are dedicated to quality, they go the extra mile to do things right the first time. By taking the right strategic action -- for example, by holding employees accountable for quality -- leaders can develop a workforce that makes smart decisions throughout the day and promotes a culture of workplace safety.\nThe mission or purpose of the company makes employees feel their job is important. Many of the world's most engaged organizations maintain a purpose-driven culture. Their leaders know why the company exists and ensure that employees understand and identify with that purpose. When workers embrace the mission of an organization and connect with that purpose both personally and professionally, they are more likely to think \"big picture\" in all areas of their work. Employees who are aligned with the company's mission are also more likely to approach their work with thoughtfulness and attention to detail, which contributes to a culture of safety.\nEmployees feel that their opinions count. It's a simple notion: Listen to workers who are closest to the action. These individuals offer a front-line perspective on organizational problems and often are well-versed in preventing and overcoming them. Leaders should encourage employees to watch for hazards and should make it easy for them to share their feedback and concerns. Most importantly, when leaders act on the information they receive, it demonstrates to employees that their opinions matter -- and it can help companies avoid preventable safety incidents.\nAn unsafe workplace can have far-reaching effects on a company and its employees. Productivity can suffer, and insurance claims can significantly damage a company's bottom line. But no company can quantify the cost of the most serious accidents. Any expenses to the business pale in comparison with the infinite cost to", "gen_completion": " families, friends, workers and the nation as a whole.\nCultures in which safety is important are not only safer places for employees; they're also healthier places for businesses. Employees are more likely to stick around and employees who are more committed and invested will strive to make their bosses proud of the work they do. When people feel like their opinions are being taken seriously by leaders across an entire organization, they are safer -- and more likely to make positive contributions to the company.\nThere are a lot of things that contribute to employee safety. But having an engaged workforce that cares about its place in the workplace is undoubtedly a major factor. When employers adopt a culture that incorporates a commitment to workplace safety, the potential consequences of such an investment can be significant. But a culture built on safety is also one that is sustainable. A safety culture built on safety can transform a troubled company into a thriving company -- and it can transform families and communities in the process.\n\">\nBy Michael O'"}
{"prefix": "DJ Premier will be the first artist to release a single on the newly-revived imprint, in a nod to its early-1990s roots.\nPatrick Moxey, the founder of dance and electronic label Ultra Music, is going back to his roots with the relaunch of Payday Records, the classic hip-hop label he created in 1992 that served as the label home of artists like Gang Starr, Group Home, Jeru the Damaja and Showbiz & A.G., among others. As part of the company's revival, Moxey is teaming back up with DJ Premier for a new single, \"Our Streets\" feat. A$AP Ferg, set to drop tomorrow (Nov. 3).\nWhen Moxey first launched Payday 25 years ago, it was at the center of New York's golden age of hip-hop, with Premier heavily involved as one of the go-to producers and, alongside Guru in Gang Starr, key artists in the scene at the time. In 1995, Payday also released the first-ever single from Jay-Z, \"In My Lifetime,\" a year before his debut album Reasonable Doubt was released in June 1996, and released a slew of albums and singles from the likes of WC and the MAAD Circle, O.C. and UTD, Mos Def's first hip-hop group.\nAlongside Premier, Payday has deals with New Orleans MC Pell, Atlanta veteran OJ Da Juiceman, U.K. rapper Yung Fume and NYC collective Gloss Gang.\n\"Hip-hop has become a global language, and I think the new Payday is here to reflect that and to help bring a bunch of diverse and talented new artists to the world,\" Moxey tells Billboard. \"Our first signings are from four different cities: New York, Atlanta, New Orleans and London. That reflects the fact that we have one computer in front of us and that computer knows no borders.\"\nPayday will operate as a standalone label with the backing of Ultra's sales, marketing and promotions structure, with product management and A&R staff in New York and the U.K. and flexible deals for its artists. And in another nod to the label's roots, Neale Easterby, the CEO of Empire Artist Management who helped manage Gang Starr along with Moxey, will serve as the label's managing director in the U.K.\n\"Payday the label came out of my warehouse parties in the early '90s; we did De La Soul's first show, we did Rob Base's first show, Q-Tip would DJ,\" Moxey says. \"That was the excitement of that time. I think that still holds true today, but with a new generation. To have those moments to do the unexpected -- that's what we're looking to do.\"\n\"Patrick always had his ear to the street and it didn't take a lot of explaining the culture since he was so involved with so many aspects of it,\" DJ Premier said in a statement. \"Our memories of growing together [are] monumental, so relaunching Payday brings it all back to the roots of where our flight to success lifted off.\"", "gen_completion": "\nAs far as he knows about the label's original format of an artist's first single being released as a free promotional release on Payday, Moxey hasn't gone back and done it as a rule, but he would certainly consider the idea. He's also not looking for anything as significant or pivotal as a full-album release in its earliest days in support of the track's release.\n\"As far as how we're going to go, at this point I'm looking to see how we can help support the new acts as much as we can and not impose one specific format,\" Moxey says. \"Let's see how we can help support all these new kids who are about to start their careers in the music business.\"\nUltra Music is also returning with its own label to focus on a broader cross-genre selection of songs to feature on its playlist, including some soulful offerings and, of course, D.R.A.M's popular breakout singles \"A"}
{"prefix": "New Jersey lawmakers approved a plan to reinstate the individual mandate to try to stabilize the health insurance market.\nTRENTON - Murphycare could look a lot like Obamacare.\nLawmakers Thursday sent to Gov. Phil Murphy a bill that will require nearly all New Jerseyans to have health insurance or pay a penalty, in a bid to stabilize premiums for consumers in the Obamacare marketplace.\nThey approved another bill that would set up a reinsurance plan that would be paid partly for by the federal government and cover some of the most expensive health care claims.\n\"It's a two-pronged attack to get at premium costs,\u201d said Linda Schwimmer, president and chief executive officer of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute, a research and advocacy group.\nThe mandate bill passed 23-13 in the Senate and 50-23 in the Assembly. The reinsurance bill passed 22-14 in the Senate and 46-22 in the Assembly. Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal in the video above discusses the state's plans to protect Obamacare.\nThe bills would most directly affect consumers who don't get health insurance through Medicare or their employer. About 275,000 people in New Jersey were covered in the individual market, according to federal data released this month.\nThey are steps by the Democrat-controlled Legislature to protect the Affordable Care Act in the face of opposition from the Trump administration and Congress.\nOne of the biggest fights: New Jersey would reinstate the so-called individual mandate that requires most New Jerseyans to have health insurance or pay a penalty \u2014 either 2.5 percent of their household income or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, whichever is greater.\nThe Trump administration eliminated the contentious provision for 2019 as part of the tax reform law, and it turned its attention to giving states more flexibility to offer less expensive \u2014 and less comprehensive \u2014 plans.\nNew Jersey long has required insurance companies to provide \"essential\" benefits that mirrored Obamcare: hospitalization, maternity care and preventive care such as colorectal screenings, to name a few.\nThe bill headed to Murphy would penalize consumers who purchase a plan that doesn't include comprehensive benefits.\nMost New Jersey consumers buying health insurance through the Obamacare marketplace have an income that is low enough to qualify for subsidies. If they don't, the price is steep; a four-person family pays about $23,000 a year, according to New Jersey Policy Perspective, a left-leaning research group.\nA recent Rutgers University poll found just 40 percent of New Jerseyans thought the state should continue the mandate, but health care experts have", "gen_completion": " been clear the mandate is crucial to restoring a healthy market by keeping healthy people and insurers.\n\"We can't have people with pre-existing conditions buying insurance, and going through catastrophic situations, only to end up losing their insurance,\" said Elnahal. \"If the mandate is reintroduced, that will help us stabilize the marketplace as a whole.\"\nSo-called premium increases are a major element in insurance premiums, because they represent increased costs for insurers. If premiums aren\u2019t rising fast enough, the federal tax penalty will become greater. For consumers who don\u2019t qualify for subsidies, those penalties increase to 5.2 percent of gross income from 2.5 percent. But the higher the income, the greater the tax penalty.\nRepublicans have said the subsidies would give healthy people pause.

{"prefix": "Around 20 years ago this wonderful matriarch in church brought a pie for one of the socials. She took care of a number of these elderberry bushes at home. It was a special pie in that I had never heard of elderberries. Personally, I still think that they taste a little like blueberries. This fruit was amazing. Don\u2019t ever turn down an elderberry pie if you have an option to have a piece. I have found that these elderberries are not widely known, but everyone that I know that has tasted these berries has loved them. From what I can see over the years this elderberry is loved by a variety of different wildlife, which will provide some competition.\nFrom my own experience I can seriously say to my reader who asked me for help with this wonderful plant a person who wants to grow them in Summit County will have success with a modest amount of effort. The only trial is that there are 25 different species around the world and at least six different cultivars of Elderberries and each of these have different requirements to some extent.\nThere are a number of different nurseries in the area that do raise elderberries. I have grown two different elderberries in my yard with success over the years. For me I think of this plant as more of a medium to tall shrub because it can grow from 5 to 12 feet tall. This compound leaf shrub does the best in moist soils but will tolerate dry soil, soil pH does not have much effect on this shrub, but grows suckers very well, because it grows stolons like strawberries.\nYou will have to prune this shrub regularly for this plant to do well. Over the centuries elderberry has been grown in hedges to access the fruit. Challenges to elderberry are a variety of borers, cankers and leaf spots, which can be serious to these plants. If you wanted more elderberry plants, you can propagate them by cuttings and seeds. Sambucus canadensis or American elder is considered a native bog plant found from Nova Scotia to Florida to Texas originally introduced in 1761 from Europe.\nSambucol a wonderful cold, cough and fever treatment an Israeli medication that we can find here in the U.S. has as the base Sambucus nigra leaves or fruit. What you can do is make a tea of the drupe or berry and some of the dried leaves as treatment even for the flu and other virus based diseases.\nAt the Kibbutz Aza in Israel many people in the Kibbutz came down with the flu so they tested Sambucol. Twenty percent of these flu sufferers showed significant relief of fever, muscle aches and other symptoms within 24 hours, 73 percent felt better after the second day, and in three days 90 percent were completely cured.\nMany cultures have used this elderberry or sambucus nigra fruit as a juice for treating tonsillitis. This sambucol stimulates the immune system and has shown success against Epstein-Barr, herpes, and even HIV. If you make a tea out of the dried leaves you may find help for arthritis, inflammation, viruses and cancer. The flavonoids in elderberries are high in anti-oxidants such as vitamin C, which has 87 percent of the RDA, Vitamin A with 17 percent RDA, and includes iron, potassium, vitamin B6 and lots of beta carotene. Flowers from the elderberry can be used as an antiseptic wash or poultice to treat wounds or eye inflammations.\nElderberries are also a favorite among many birds for many reasons. Just think there are 120 different species of birds that have elderberries on their menus according to one author that is a great source of information. Robins will start eating elderberries early before they are ripe. You will need to cover this", "gen_completion": " plant, give it ample water, and keep the soil moist if you can because it will not do well if it has too much water and it has a tendency to mold.

I prefer a full 10-foot plant because it stays healthy and the fruit does the best when you can reach it. I recommend a 10-foot plant with well-moistured soil because it does well. My recommendation on this plant is that it needs more water and it also needs more water right now. You will find some wonderful elders in our Summit County.

It wants to maintain current spending levels on missile defense and nuclear weapons while increasing spending on cybersecurity.\nTthe department sought to assert that it was simultaneously taking risks and not losing any conventional capability. It said it was responding to growing fiscal pressures because this proposal represented the biggest cut it had made in a decade.\nTheir proposal, officials have said, carries risks because the U.S. military no longer would be able to fight two wars simultaneously and might be required to make difficult decisions about military priorities.\n\"The primary risk lies not in what we can do but in how much we can do and how fast we can do it,\" said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nFor the 2013 fiscal year, the department requests a $525 billion base budget \u2014 a $6 billion decrease from the current budget \u2014 and an additional $88.4 billion in supplemental funding for the war in Afghanistan, down from $115 billion this year.\nFor 2014, the request for the base budget \u2014 which excludes war spending \u2014 jumps to $534 billion; by fiscal year 2017 it reaches $567 billion.\nThe department, which expanded the size of its ground forces quickly over the past decade to support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, plans to cut the Army by 2017 to 490,000 soldiers from the current 562,000. Over the same period, the Marines would shrink by 20,000 to 182,000.\nThat would still leave a larger military than before the wars started. In 2001, there were 480,000 soldiers and 180,000 Marines.\nIn line with the smaller forces, the Pentagon calls for retiring planes that transport troops, including 27 C-5As and 65 C-130s. The budget also proposes modest limits on pay raises that would take effect in 2015 \u2014 after the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan is expected to be over \u2014 and increases in health care premiums.\nPanetta said the administration would ask Congress to authorize another round of cuts at U.S. military bases through the base realignment and closure process, which was last employed in 2005. He didn't offer specifics.\nRegardless, the suggestion alone could spark outrage on Capitol Hill, especially in an election year. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Thursday that he wouldn't support closing domestic bases before U.S. bases in Europe were shuttered.\nRep. William \"Mac\" Thornberry, R-Texas, called the proposal for a new BRAC round \"ridiculous, and there is likely little support in Congress for such a thing, on either side of the aisle or either side of the Capitol. It will cause disruptions across the services, yet offer little in terms of", "gen_completion": " additional military readiness.\"\nBut it also is likely to stoke debate in Congress, particularly over how to close some $50 billion worth of bases and realign the rest. The president has faced pressure to phase out the number of bases in Europe, and the Pentagon has taken a less defensive stance than some of the military leaders, who say it needs more bases in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, where more nations are competing for U.S. troops.\nDefense Secretary Leon Panetta said the administration wouldn't be interested in reducing that number during the budget process, but if the next president were to close a lot of the current bases in Europe, the U.S. would have to adjust.\nThat drew an interesting response Thursday, when Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the national security panel with oversight over the Pentagon, said he would oppose closing bases in Europe. \"If we did take that step, I certainly would not support closing a lot"}

On May 11, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) notified the World Health Organization that one of its citizens had been infected with the Ebola virus. The announcement marked the start of the country\u2019s first Ebola outbreak since the historically unprecedented West African epidemic that infected 28,000 people between 2014 and 2016, and killed more than 11,000.\nBut after just 42 days, it was all over.\nWith the last confirmed patient having tested negative for the virus for the second time in a row, the WHO declared an end to the outbreak on Sunday. Just four people had died, and just four more had become infected.\nBut just as importantly, once the first cases were confirmed, the response was fast, decisive, and coordinated\u2014all qualities that were initially missing in West Africa. The DRC response shows that when everything goes right, Ebola can be quickly brought to heel, even when it hits poor, remote places. \u201cWith the end of this epidemic, DRC has once again proved to the world that we can control the very deadly Ebola virus if we respond early in a coordinated and efficient way,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO\u2019s new Director-General, in a statement.\nThe symptoms of Ebola are greatly exaggerated in the popular press. It\u2019s not a disease of apocalyptic hemorrhaging from every orifice, and symptoms can easily be mistaken for other maladies. In this case, the first patient\u2014a 45-year-old man who contracted the virus on 22 April\u2014initially went to see a traditional healer. When that didn\u2019t work, he took a taxi to a health center\u2014and died on the way. (Both the driver, and a third individual who cared for the man, also eventually died.) The center quickly suspected Ebola and immediately sent samples to a national laboratory in Kinshasa. The staff there had the right knowledge, training, and connections\u2014they ran some preliminary tests while also calling international colleagues. Rimoin flew over with the latest diagnostics.\nAfter the first positive case was confirmed, the government immediately notified the WHO, which activated their emergency protocols. That inaccessibility of Likati was both a blessing and a curse\u2014it made it harder for the virus to spread, but also harder for health workers to reach the infected zone. Fortunately, after the sluggish response to the West African Ebola epidemic, the WHO had set up a $41 million contingency fund to ensure that money would be readily available for future emergencies. This fund allowed them and other organizations to quickly rent helicopters for flying personnel, generators, and supplies into Likati. \u201cWithin 24 hours, we could start airlifting,\u201d says Ibrahima-Soce Fall, director of the health security and emergencies cluster at the WHO\u2019s African office.\nThe team set up a base camp and", "gen_completion": " began running PCR tests there; in under 24 hours, results from 36 tests came back positive.

Macron is a free-trader; Trump just imposed protectionist tariffs on steel and aluminum. Macron wants the United States to remain in Syria; Trump wants to get out. Macron wants to preserve the Iran nuclear deal; Trump wants to scrap it. Macron wants the United States to rejoin the Paris climate deal; Trump withdrew from the accord.\nAnd yet there they were, the French and American presidents air-kissing on the White House portico, clasping hands at the podium of a joint news conference, clutching arms as they walked down the colonnade and clinked glasses at the first state dinner of the Trump presidency. \u201cHe is perfect,\u201d Trump declared of Macron (after brushing what he said was dandruff off of the French leader\u2019s suit).

Too many in Washington can no longer tell the difference.\nInstead of simply applauding Macron\u2019s words, perhaps Democrats ought to emulate Macron\u2019s actions. Today, the Democratic Party is no longer the opposition; it is the self-proclaimed \u201cresistance\u201d that considers its job to stop Trump from doing or accomplishing anything. Even in areas where both parties traditionally cooperate, such as the approval of qualified nominees, Trump\u2019s candidates face near unified Democratic opposition. While cooperation on difficult issues such as tax cuts or Obamacare may be a bridge too far, Democrats are so blinded by their contempt for Trump that they cannot bring themselves to work with him on issues where they profess to agree, such as infrastructure or extending protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. These failures hurt the millions of ordinary people who depend on leaders in Washington to work together for the good of the country.\nMacron\u2019s visit has shown that it does not have to be this way; people can vigorously disagree and still find ways to work together.

{"prefix": "For decades, U.S. schools have failed to provide students with an adequate civics education, which is integral to building and maintaining an engaged and informed voting population.\nHow bad is it? According to the 2018 Annenberg Constitution Day Civics Survey, only 32 percent of Americans can name all three branches of the U.S. government. Even worse, 33 percent could not correctly name one branch.\nUnfortunately, this lack of basic civics knowledge is not restricted to U.S. adults. In 2014, only 23 percent of American students earned a proficient score on the civics portion of the \u201cNation\u2019s Report Card\u201d exam. Needless to say, this does not bode well for the future.\nGiven these startling statistics, one would assume that American educators would be working feverishly to find new ways to improve civics courses. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case. Only nine states and the District of Columbia require a full year of civics education as a requirement for high school graduation. Thirty-one states require students enroll in only one half-year course.\nAlthough several solutions have been proposed by educators and researchers to solve the civics crisis, none have been widely adopted. One of the most significant civics-related proposals is to require all high school students to pass the U.S. citizenship test, the same test that all immigrants must earn a passing score on before becoming a citizen. Although the movement started with much fanfare, it has since fizzled out; only 17 states have such a requirement.\nSchools are failing miserably to educate millions of Americans in basic civics. However, all is not lost. With a few reasonable changes, a civics education Renaissance is more than attainable.\nAs a former public high school teacher, one who taught courses in both American government and U.S. history, I have firsthand experience in the civics classroom crisis. Like many who have taught these courses before, I believe it is virtually impossible to provide children with the civics education they need in an eight-week civics \u201ccrash course.\u201d It\u2019s simply not enough time to dive into this important and complex subject. Civics, at the very least, should be a full-year course, and students should be offered opportunities to take additional, more advanced civics courses as well.\nSecond, civics standards need a total overhaul. It\u2019s not enough to teach kids how bills become laws, they need to know more about their rights as Americans and understand the history behind the constitutional protections they have been provided. The United States is an exceptional place, but most students are being taught the opposite is true. Yes, some truly terrible things have happened in America \u2014 just as they have in all countries \u2014 but the United States\u2019 commitment to personal freedom has made America the most powerful, wealthy, successful nation the world has ever seen. Students need to understand these ideas. Civics isn\u2019t about laws, it\u2019s about rights and personal freedom.\nThird, state standards are too narrowly focused on knowledge attainment. States typically don\u2019t offer students any form of experiential learning as part of their civics standards. No wonder youth participation in politics is abysmally low. If schools want to improve civics scores, they should teach children why civics is important, and the best way to do that is by getting them directly involved with the lawmaking process through internships, volunteer opportunities, and field trips to local and state government buildings, including state capitols.\nAnother way to increase student engagement is to emphasize student government in schools. If students are able to get actively involved in the governance of their own schools", "gen_completion": ", they might actually benefit and be excited about civics classes in the future. If there is one thing that can motivate all students to learn, it\u2019s the potential to make a life-long impact.\nIf there was one thing we learned in our political science and government courses in high school, it\u2019s that learning how the government works can open someone up to so many opportunities in the world beyond the classroom, from research and writing assignments to internships. With a desire to learn more, everyone is better prepared to be a lifelong learner. Whether that be through internships, student clubs, or other hands-on experiences, everyone needs to be exposed to it. Unfortunately, current state standards leave students with few meaningful opportunities.\nA full-year government requirements is a small start, but it\u2019s something. It\u2019s a start, because civics as a subject should never simply sit as a mere background, offering nothing but an afternoon of class work"}
{"prefix": "Apple: dead in the water, or on top of its game?\nSince I was reading this on my iPad Pro, which is probably the most useful electronic device I have ever owned, it came as a bit of a shock. But in fact Volker was really just articulating a truth about digital hardware, which is that the evolution of all such products (and a good deal else besides) follows a sigmoid curve.\nIt sounds complicated, but it isn\u2019t really. Think of it as a version of the letter S that\u2019s been flattened to form a graph whose vertical axis measures functionality while the horizontal axis represents time. What it tells you is that initially (at the lower part of the S) a new technology develops relatively slowly. Then there\u2019s a point where the functionality increases dramatically over a relatively short period, after which the rate of improvement declines steadily and levels off. The iPad is now somewhere on that upper plateau, which means that it\u2019s reached the point where one can only expect incremental improvements (faster processor, better screen, stereo audio etc). This is what Volker was getting at when he said that the device is \u201cdone\u201d.\nTo the hyperactive tech media sector this means that the product is no longer of any interest and that Apple has \u201crun out of ideas\u201d. In some cases it is also taken as confirmation that the company has never recovered from the death of Steve Jobs. Excitable Wall Street analysts may also see it as evidence that Apple stock should now be downgraded to \u201csell\u201d. All of which merely confirms the extent to which some of those who opine about technology don\u2019t understand it.\nSo let\u2019s put the iPad in its wider context.

Since then, the candidates have gotten tougher on each other.\nOnce upon a time, the Republican presidential contenders seemed to be mostly on the same page. They agreed on who the real enemies were \u2014 as Newt Gingrich explained at a debate in September.\n\"All of my friends up here are going to repudiate every effort of the news media to get Republicans to fight each other to protect Barack Obama, who deserves to be defeated,\" he said. \"And all of us are committed as a team \u2014 whoever the nominee is, we are all for defeating Barack Obama.\"\nWell, that team seems to have broken up.

But most Republican voters remain unconvinced. Romney's percentage of support has generally been stuck in the high teens to low 20s. And now, he feels Gingrich breathing down his neck \u2014 or is it the other way around?\nOn Fox News, Romney went on the attack, calling Gingrich \"a lifelong politician.\"\n\"I think you have to have the credibility of understanding how the economy works,\" Romney continued. \"And I do. And that's one reason I'm in this race.\"\nRomney also slammed Gingrich for saying that illegal immigrants who had been in this country for a long time, put down roots and raised a family shouldn't automatically be deported.\n\"If he's going to do what I believe he's said he was going to do for those people who would be allowed to stay permanently and become citizens, that would be providing for them a form of amnesty,\" Romney said, knowing that would be anathema to most conservative voters.\n\"It's time for him to show some teeth,\" says Republican political analyst Ed Rogers.\nIt's getting to be time to get undecideds to make a decision. It's getting to be time to build up yourself and diminish your opponents.\nHe says Romney has to protect his position as a leading candidate.\n\"And it's time for him to make sure that nobody builds up a head of steam where he really gets behind and has to become so harshly negative that it", "gen_completion": " could get him in trouble,\" says Rogers, who's in Ann Arbor, Mich., working on election coverage.\nMeanwhile, Texas Governor Rick Perry has taken a shot at Gingrich's experience.

{"prefix": "The where and when are still to be determined, but there\u2019s no doubt that Parsons, the Kingston native who played at Archbishop Williams High School, will soon set the record for goals scored by a minor pro player. The 39-year-old winger netted No. 674 on Thanksgiving Night, leaving him just four from passing Kevin Kerr\u2019s 677.\nThe funny thing is, there was every reason to doubt Parsons would ever be in such a position. He only scored 18 goals in 107 career NCAA games at UMass-Lowell, after all \u2013 but there was a reason.\nIt took famously hard-nosed former NHLer Nick Fotiu to put Parson\u2019s soft hands to use. As a rookie head coach for the East Coast Hockey League\u2019s Nashville Knights, Fotiu agreed to his first-year pro\u2019s request to play forward in 1992-93, and Parsons scored 27 goals \u2013 amazingly, his career low for a season \u2013 as a third-line winger.\nParsons was soon on a tour of the ECHL, playing in Tallahassee, Fla.; Johnstown, Pa.; Lafayette and Baton Rouge, La., through 1998-99. The first of his six 50-goal seasons came in his only year in Johnstown (1995-96), and while it wasn\u2019t his favorite stop, none was more important: He met his wife, Kristen, when he was a Chief.\n\u201cDefinitely the silver lining to that year,\u201d said Parsons, today the father of daughters Abby (8), Maggy (6) and Maddox (5).\nThe next season was big, too: In \u201996-97, Parsons first played under well-traveled ex-NHLer Doug Shedden (Pittsburgh, Detroit, Quebec, Toronto) for the first time with the ECHL\u2019s Louisiana IceGators. Shedden next brought Parsons with him to Flint, Mich., where they won the 1999-200 United Hockey League championship, and then to Memphis of the Central Hockey League, where they won back-to-back titles (2001-02 and \u201902-03). Parsons scored at least 54 goals in his first three seasons with Memphis, and was twice named CHL Most Valuable Player.\nThe closest the ride came to ending was after 2006-2007, when Parsons\u2019 Quad City Mallards moved to the American Hockey League, leading the UHL to morph into a \u201cnew,\u201d scaled-down version of the IHL. (The \u201coriginal\u201d IHL, like the AHL a step below the NHL, folded after 2000-2001.) Bloomington claimed Parsons in a dispersal draft, and Parsons decided he could handle the two-hour drive from the Quad City region (on the Mississippi River, encompassing communities in Illinois and Iowa) to the U.S. Cellular Arena in Bloomington, home of the Prairie Thunder.\nDespite the long drive, Parsons is never far from reminders of the record he\u2019s pursuing.\nA player", "gen_completion": "\u2019s jersey is rarely more memorable than when he passes it out after games, or reads it or shows up at an organization\u2019s charity fundraiser.

{"prefix": "Less than a century since DDT was first sprayed, the spread of the Zika virus through mosquitoes has left some wondering whether regulators were too quick to move away from the chemical. But public health officials warn returning the controversial pesticide to use could do more harm than good in some places.\nDDT, which first came into use as an insecticide in the 1930s, played a crucial role helping Allied forces protect themselves from mosquitoes carrying malaria in World World II and eventually helped eliminate the deadly disease from the U.S. But despite its successes, public opinion turned quickly in the 1960s as outrage grew over DDT\u2019s potential risks to human health and animals and many countries joined the U.S. in ultimately banning its use.\nToday, health officials caution that while the benefits of the pesticide can outweigh health concerns in some contexts, spraying DDT to combat Zika would be premature and potentially very misguided.\nThe first concern for public health officials when considering whether to use DDT is if the method of applying the pesticide will actually kill the targeted mosquitoes. Most applications of the pesticide today occur on the walls of indoor dwellings\u2014targeting mosquitoes that prey on humans while they sleep at night. This tactic, frequently used in Africa, works in areas where mosquitoes carrying disease bite at night while people are asleep, according to Lynn Goldman, dean of the George Washington University School of Public Health. More research is needed to understand other mosquito populations and learn whether DDT use will be effective.\nPolicymakers also have to weigh the potential effects of DDT on human health. The impact of the chemical is not necessarily immediate, but can be devastating to those who ingest it. Research has suggested that DDT has the potential to disrupt the human nervous system in the same way it does to insects. That may mean cancer, infertility and other long-term health effects including developmental problems in young children. DDT remains in the environment where it\u2019s sprayed for years, potentially affecting multiple generations.\nTaking", "gen_completion": " into account the potential risks and benefits of DDT and other insecticides are critical in deciding how much pesticides are needed to battle mosquito-borne disease.

While Brazil was able to eliminate malaria by implementing widespread DDT use in the 1970s\u2014its success was driven by its widespread use in Africa\u2014other countries have suffered due to a lack of monitoring due to bureaucratic processes that restrict reporting to local governments. The number of insecticide-treated mosquito larvicides needed to wipe out locally transmitted mosquito-borne diseases in Africa can range anywhere from 1 to 10 billion litres, making extensive monitoring critical.\nIn Europe, where studies have shown that outdoor spraying of DDT on crops can help prevent a severe winter malaria infection, spraying may allow for a quick assessment of the costs and benefits of such use\u2014allowing the public"}
{"prefix": "Project will pay growers to try methods to keep harmful carbon in the soil.\nOn 1,100 acres of farmland near Austin, Minn., 47-year-old Tom Cotter has embraced no-till planting and cover crops that keep carbon stored in his soil and out of the atmosphere. Cotter changed his farming methods for financial reasons, not just to fight climate change, and stuck with them long enough to see them pay off.\nCotter sees a new pilot program in the 2018 federal farm bill that pays farmers to experiment with the same growing style as a chance for others to enjoy the economic and environmental benefits he has.\nThe $25 million test project will measure how much additional carbon the agriculture sector can keep out of the atmosphere by leaving fields untilled or minimally tilled and covered with vegetation.\nFarming techniques that fight climate change by increasing carbon stored in soil do not work everywhere, explained Tim Smith, a professor of bioproducts and biosystems engineering at the University of Minnesota. But where they do work, soil quality and productivity improves. They also reduce the need for fertilizers that contribute to carbon in the atmosphere.\nThe pilot program aims to \u201creward farmers for sequestering carbon in their soil, but we need to verify that they are doing that,\u201d said David Kolsrud, who farmed in Luverne before starting a private funding group and working in the renewable-energy sector.\nThe carbon sequestration experiment in the farm bill was the brainchild of an unlikely coalition that includes the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) as well as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the American Coalition for Ethanol. Those normally competing groups came together to persuade Congress to fund a model for encouraging farming that is simultaneously profitable and environmentally friendly.\nThe project will pay selected participants to revive old farming methods to draw more carbon from the atmosphere into the soil and keep it there.\n\u201cAg [has] a major opportunity to protect the climate,\u201d said Nicole Lederer of E-2, a group that advocates for policies that work economically as well as environmentally. Lederer helped broker the deal between the corn growers and the resource council that led to the pilot program.\nFundamentally, the program relies on disturbing the soil as little as possible to limit the release of carbon stored in the roots of plants and decomposing vegetation. It also emphasizes keeping ground covered with crops year-round to prevent the release of carbon from erosion by water or wind.\nCotter said the combination reduces the need for fertilizer. \u201cInstead of spending 20 bucks an acre killing the ground, I want my soil livestock [worms and other organic creatures] doing my tillage,\u201d he said.\nThat can mean planting cover crops rather than letting fields lie fallow. It especially means cutting down on or eliminating tillage, said Lara Bryant, NRDC\u2019s deputy director of water and agriculture nature programs.\nNo-till or low-till farming requires some special equipment. Cotter grows no-till soybeans using an $1,800 adjustment to the closing mechanism on his planter. He grows low-till corn by planting seed in narrow bands about 10 inches wide. He bought a used vertical till machine for $8,000 at auction to help do that and shared the cost of the machine with a neighbor.\nThese sorts of techniques fell out of favor in the 1970s when plentiful land and expanding crop production led farmers to use \u201cmore extractive systems,\u201d according to Bryant.

But starting in 2009, juries will be participating in Japanese courts, under what is called a \"saibanin\" system.\nThe new system has not yet been confirmed. At first, it will be tested for three years. And it will be limited in scope.

He spoke to journalists in Tokyo on Thursday.\n\"The saibanin system and these other reforms are intended to transform Japanese citizens from viewing themselves as governed objects into governing objects,\" Precht says.\nFor each trial, there will be a panel of three judges and six jurors, who will be citizens selected at random.\nThe jury panel will sit in the same room with the judges to deliberate on the evidence and reach a verdict.

Outlets that had previously shied away from, and in some cases covered up, abuses by the Hollywood producer began harassment investigations that saw a host of household media names pushed from their pedestals.\nItaly, home to two of Harvey Weinstein's accusers, also felt the shockwaves. But Italians hoping for a similar impact on their fourth estate, where victim-blaming and objectification are notoriously common - were to be disappointed.\nInstead, two features marked the fallout: the near absence of names named, and the ferocious reaction faced not by the accused, but the accusers.\nItaly, it would seem, had missed its \"Weinstein moment\".\nThe problem is, it's difficult to expose such cases, especially when they happen in the industry that is supposed to be doing the exposing! And that's an industry whose leaders tend to be, on the whole, men.\nSix months on from the scandal, The Listening Post went to Rome and Milan to ask journalists and media experts why the scandal played out so differently in Italy, and to discuss the problematic representation of women in Italy's media more generally.\nOne of Weinstein's Italian accusers is the actress Asia Argento, whose testimony of sexual assault met a media response that - with some exceptions - ranged from scepticism to open abuse.\n\"First they go along with it, then they whine and pretend to repent\", goaded a headline in the conservative newspaper, Libero.

Pietro Senaldi's explanation was simple: \"What I think is that in Italy, this phenomenon has not exploded because it is less dramatic than it is in the States. Definitely less dramatic.\"\nIt's a notion each of our female interviewees strongly disputed, pointing out that such cases are not hard to find - if you are looking for them.\n\"Just because there have been no denunciations to date doesn't mean it isn't happening in the media as well,\" said Claudia Torrisi, a contributor to VICE Italy.\n\"The problem is, it's difficult to expose such cases, especially when they happen in the industry that is supposed to be doing the exposing!

According to the team, Greene is taking antibiotics to treat the infection, which was caught early.\nThe team said it could not determine whether or not it is a staph infection because skin infections like his cannot be cultured. But a team spokesman said today that Greene is responding well to antibiotics and is expected back next week.\nThe team clarified Ryan's explanation of Greene's infection. Earlier this week, Greene had calluses shaved off his feet and received a local anesthetic for that procedure. While that was being done, he asked about irritation on another part of his foot, later diagnosed as a \"standard, routine skin infection.\"\nGreene did not have pus or fluid in his foot as a result of the skin infection, the team said. But swelling and irritation can result from standing on an infected foot, which is why Greene must keep it elevated. He is in the building today.\n\"Nobody seems too concerned with it,\" Ryan said.\nRyan also did not express concern with the infection spreading through the facility.\n\"You can eat off these floors,\" Ryan said. \"They clean it like crazy. We try everything we can to make sure that never happens. We've never had an issue like that and hopefully we never will.\"\nIn Greene's absence, LaDainian Tomlinson will start at running back. Joe McKnight (head) is expected to be cleared to play, and rookie Bilal Powell may receive a heavier load of snaps as well.\nWR Plaxico Burress (left ankle) will carry a full load in Sunday's preseason game, Ryan said.

The Jets will likely be more cautious with Johnson, the team's leading receiver, in his preseason debut. He worked as a wide receiver in practices throughout training camp, often working with the second unit. He practiced in full during Wednesday's walkthrough.

A 27-year-old woman was also injured in the attack, but she managed to escape along with upstairs tenants as a fire consumed the building.\nOn Feb. 4, the Broome County District Attorney's Office offered to settle a recent set of felony charges against Pica-Torres \u2014 burglary, grand larceny and criminal mischief \u2014 by a guilty plea to a misdemeanor petit larceny in Binghamton City Court.

He also could have been convicted as a persistent felony offender, a designation that carries a potential sentence of 25 years to life.\n\"The current administration at the District Attorney's Office is utterly broken,\" Battisti said Wednesday. \"Any reasonable person would come to the conclusion that a repeat violent offender with a history of domestic violence is a threat.\"\nCornwell responded late Wednesday in a statement: \"Shame on Paul Battisti for exploiting the death of a victim for political advantage.

{"prefix": "The recent Supreme Court decision in NIFLA v. Becerra struck down a California law that required so-called \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers\u201d (CPCs) to disclose whether they are licensed medical facilities, and what health services they do and not offer. By a 5-4 margin, the ruling permits these fake women\u2019s health centers to continue to hide important, basic facts, and dodge direct questions about reproductive health.\nIn Minnesota, the deceptively titled \u201cWomen\u2019s Right to Know Act\u201d requires individuals to receive state-mandated counseling before they can access a legal abortion. Included on the list of approved counseling options are a number of CPCs, with no mention of the fact that these facilities are strongly biased against abortion and may not have licensed health care providers on staff. In stepping up to promote the deceptive practices at CPCs, state lawmakers continue to support this charade and participate in deceiving everyday Minnesotans who are seeking needed health care.\n73 percent of CPCs told patients that abortion is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer, a claim rejected throughout the medical and scientific community. In agreement, the American Cancer Society adds, \u201cthe public is not well served by false alarms\u201d about cancer risks.\nMore than half of CPCs gave patients bad information about birth control, often exaggerating its failure rates and side effects. In fact, it is not only safe and everyday health care, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention named birth control one the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.\nEven in their arguments before the Supreme Court, CPCs barely dispute that they deceive women, hinting that they know patients who hear the facts will make decisions that don\u2019t serve their anti-abortion, anti-birth control agenda. Instead, they assert that it\u2019s their right to deceive. Five Supreme Court justices sided with them, and Trump\u2019s Title X proposal would back their deceptive practices with public dollars.\nOver the past month, I\u2019ve been traveling across the state and hearing from people who rely on affordable birth control and other reproductive health care to finish their education, achieve career goals, or just to lead healthier, happier lives. I\u2019ve also heard from people still rattled from experiences with CPCs.

To these women, CPCs are not licensed medical facilities, no matter how they name themselves, but abortion centers that employ deceptive deceptive practices to avoid providing people basic reproductive health care and information. If these deceptive practices should continue to keep state support flowing to them, Minnesotans deserve a better option, which is why I am joining the Senate Democrats to introduce the State Population and Reproductive Health Omnibus Bill.\nThe legislation will provide access to abortion services throughout Minnesota, regardless of what a CPC\u2019s name says.

Then visit us in person.\nRaised in September 1862, the 155th NYVI served with distinction until July 1865. Almost all of the men of the 155th were Irish; many of them had only come to America since the time of the Famine of 1846-47.\nThe 155th was raised as part of Michael Corcoran's \"Irish Legion,\" a brigade containing the 155th, 164th (zouave), 170th, 175th, and 182nd New York Volunteers. Members of Companies \"I\" and \"K\" came from Buffalo, New York, and the 164th also contained Buffalo recruits. The regiment fought under both the flag of the United States, and a green, regimental color with Irish and New York state symbols.\nThe 155th's first fight was in January 1863 in Virginia, and over the next two and a half years, the regiment actively campaigned in the East. It served in a number of major battles, including the Siege of Suffolk, Virginia; Spotsylvania, North Anna, and Cold Harbor, where the regiment saw its heaviest losses. The 155th took part in the Siege of Petersburg, and fighting around that area, and it was part of the forces that chased the Army of Northern Virginia to its destiny, being present at the that force's surrender at Appomattox Court House.\nThe unit mustered into United States service with 820 men; by July 1865, only 130 men were present at Lee's surrender at Appomattox, Virginia.\nDuring the war, many 155th members also belonged to the Fenian Brotherhood. After the war, these veterans joined the 7th New York Regiment of the Irish Army of Liberation, which in June 1866, joined the Fenian invasion of Canada, fighting the Battle of Ridgeway, Ontario, and several smaller actions around Fort Erie. Though victorious on the field, the heavily outnumbered, and unsupported attempt to take control of Canada (to hold for the exchange for Irish independence from Great Britain), failed.

She was a sixty-three-year-old chicken farmer, living in the Ozarks with her husband and their daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, a well-known journalist and popular author. Wilder\u2019s own literary ambitions were, she told Lane, for \u201cprestige\u201d rather than for money, and they may have dated to her youth, though they had been thwarted by a married life of hardship and calamity.\nWilder would certainly capture the big market. She lived to the age of ninety, and published eight novels for young people\u2014the perennially beloved \u201cLittle House\u201d books\u2014that have sold some sixty million copies in more than thirty languages. In the nineteen-seventies, the third installment of this family saga, \u201cLittle House on the Prairie,\u201d was adapted as a drama for television that ran for nine seasons. The Wilder farmhouse, in Rocky Ridge, Missouri, has become a shrine that receives some forty thousand pilgrims a year, and six other sites mentioned in the series are landmarks or museums devoted to its lore. But the memoir that Wilder drafted during the first year of the Depression, in her tidy longhand, filling a series of school notebooks, was never published until now.\n\u201cPioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography\u201d is a handsomely illustrated, large-format volume that represents years of work by a team of scholars. Their project was sponsored by the South Dakota Historical Society, and published by its state-subsidized press last November. Its modest first print run quickly sold out, and it is currently back-ordered on Amazon, where it occupies the number one slot on the best-seller list in the category of American biography. Wilder fans are a devoted breed, and there is nothing surprising about the book\u2019s popularity\u2014until you wade into it.\nMy greatest trouble this spring was that I couldn\u2019t get past the multiplication table at school. I just couldn\u2019t memorize it and we couldn\u2019t go on to arithmetic until we could say the multiplication table. Those who passed were going up stairs next terms and I would have to stay behind. So I was glad when Ma said she needed me to help her and I would have to stay out of school for a while.\nI helped Ma with the work, ran errands and every day worked sums in multiplication looking back at the multiplication table to help me when I couldn\u2019t remember.\nOne day when I came back from an errand that had taken me a long time, I found a new little sister.\nWilder desperately needed an editor, and luckily she had one\u2014if not something more. Rose Wilder Lane\u2019s astute and rigorous biographer, William Holtz, made a persuasive case, in \u201cThe Ghost in the Little House,\u201d that Lane was her mother\u2019s ghostwriter. She encouraged Wilder to recast the memoir as a series of \u201cjuveniles,\u201d and, in the course of a decade, they cannibalized, sanitized, and romanticized \u201cPioneer Girl\u201d for the \u201cLittle House\u201d books.", "gen_completion": " In the beginning, I was delighted to be part of the story.

{"prefix": "Look out! There's an app barreling toward your skull, and it's going as fast as a car.\nAmong the most powerful things about the first iPhone was how it made old software metaphors \u2014 pressing buttons, scrolling through pages \u2014 much more literal. Scrolling was now linked, one-to-one, to the tip of your finger. You didn't click a button on a mouse to command a software cursor to press a button for you, you just tapped it with your thumb. This was a profound change and one that was hard to advertise or talk about. But it was something that users were able to grasp almost immediately.\nMovement in iOS, and in Android, is generally directly connected to one of two actions: a tapping or swiping, or hitting a button or dragging (or pushing!) something around. The weirdest these direct actions really get is pinch-to-zoom, which is somehow intuitive but doesn't really have a real-world equivalent. These are all vital in making iOS feel like iOS.\nAlso vital: the animations, which, in iOS 7, are centered around zooming. Or, more accurately, flying. Tapping an icon sends it flying at your face, at which point it begins to transform into an app. Closing it pulls it back away from you; it's as if the app is falling into the screen. Our minds take every other movement metaphor in iOS literally, but this one is weird. It feels three-dimensional in a way that others don't.\nThe sensation of depth is exaggerated in iOS 7, and profound enough that it led some users to complain of a sort of seasickness (which Apple both acknowledged and provided a fix for, in an update).\nI used the small-angle approximation since the size of the object (in this case the app) is significantly smaller than the distance from which you are observing it. This allowed us to assume that the apparent size of the object is inversely proportional to the distance from which you are observing it.\nIn order for an iPhone app to appear to be the width of an iPhone icon, it would have to be about 5.33 feet away. That is to say, if iOS animations suggest that the icons are falling away from you, they are falling about 5 feet, and moving pretty fast. Assuming it takes about 0.8 seconds for this animation to complete, the app is moving at an average of about 6.6 feet per second, or about 4.5 miles per hour: a slow jogging speed.\nThose 19.29 feet are traveled, again, in about 0.8 seconds, which works out to a little more than 24.1 feet per second, or 16.4 miles per hour. That's an average too \u2014 the animation accelerates then decelerates. Or", "gen_completion": " rather, the apps are moving so quickly that we don't notice that they're running away from us.\nThis is one of the strangest things in iOS 8 and why we are not yet certain what it is or how it came to be. But we do know that no motion has ever seemed even vaguely real.\nThe amount of time it takes to zoom is dependent upon the camera resolution, so if your iPhone is at 8 megapixels then it will take 11.3 seconds to zoom. If it is at 1.2 megapixels, which the iPhone 4S and 4sS did, it will take 12.2 seconds. If it's lower, it takes 14.1 seconds. If it's higher, it takes, well, we'll stop counting.\nA lot gets misordered when you do a \"zoom test\" in iOS 8. When the animation decelerates then accelerates again, you quickly think that these are the same two actions. A"}
{"prefix": "You might be shocked to learn exactly how much those bad habits are costing you in potential retirement savings.\nWe get it. You enjoy your morning latte, and we don't want to take that away from you. But we could all cut back on some guilty pleasures without sucking the fun out of life.\nDon't think you can do it? Take a look at just how much more money you'll have in retirement if you make these small changes to your spending habits.\nDining out in restaurants is fun, but doing it too often is expensive and unnecessary. Get into the habit of eating at home for just one weekend a month, that's all we're asking for. You can still go out for dinner every other Friday and Saturday night. The average American spends $252 a month eating out, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you skip two restaurant meals, we figure you'll save $63. By the time you hit retirement age, you'll have a couple hundred thousand extra in the bank.\nA quicker ride home is always tempting. But barring a torrential downpour, maybe the convenience isn't always worth the cost. Though a $20 cab ride might not seem like a big splurge, doing it once a week is costing you $960 a year. That alone could be enough to buy you an entire house in retirement.\nCan't stand to give up the convenience for good? If a cab-free life feels like too much of a sacrifice to you, try doing it for just one year. You'll still end up with an extra $19,365 in retirement.\nSmoking a pack a day costs Americans an average of $176 a month, according to WalletHub. Plus, it's bad for you, so quitting is a win-win. If you have trouble kicking the habit, just think of the cumulative savings of well over half a million dollars. When we did the math we assumed you'll go cold turkey -- and never go back.\nDon't worry, you can still splurge on a latte here and there. But consider this: A $10 bag of ground coffee should last you at least a month and still give you the same caffeine fix. So skip buying your daily $2.50 Cup of Joe and brew it at home. As a reward, splurge on a tall Starbucks latte once a week. You'll still come out ahead $24 a month.\nIt's important to stay fit, but there are plenty of ways to do it that won't put your financial health at", "gen_completion": " risk. You could walk 100 extra miles a year, or do some yoga for a total walk-insch goal of 1,000 daily miles. You'll still end up saving thousands by not spending so much time sitting in a car. You'll be working hard, but you'll be working hard toward a much more comfortable retirement.\nEven if you don't feel like cooking, your pantry isn't the finished product. The more meals you cook, the less time you're spending buying and preparation food, the less likely you are to spend on fast-food outings. Plus, healthier eating is a win-win for everyone. When you cook at least 2,500 meals a year, you save nearly $500 a year.\nSo give up your weekend brunch getaway and take on more grocery chores instead. But before you start, make sure to budget out the time. You'll be surprised how easily $10 a week goes in the right direction.\nCan't afford $9"}

{"prefix": "By Monday night, 23-year-old Tori Kelly might be in possession of her very first Grammy. But only a year ago, she was a relative unknown whose audiences were rooted mainly in YouTube subscriptions.\nKelly, who auditioned for American Idol's ninth season as a teenager in 2010, was cut from the show just before the its live semi-finals after some particularly harsh criticism from judge Simon Cowell. While the rejection hit Kelly hard, she told Ryan Seacrest last year it incited her to buckle down on her craft and prove her worth as a musician.\n\"I was bummed when I got cut, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then it was kind of awesome because, I think, by getting cut from the show, something stirred up in me to want to write.\"\nAnd that's precisely what she did. In 2012, after releasing six-track EP Handmade Songs By Tori Kelly that Kelly, herself, produced in her bedroom, the singer caught Scooter Braun's eye, and found herself under Capitol Records' management within the year. A second EP, Foreword, continued to cultivate a fan base, and demonstrated her appeal as a complete, wild-maned package.\nIt was 2015, though, that signaled Kelly's rise into official breakthrough artist territory. At the 2015 Billboard Music Awards, and armed with only an acoustic guitar, she tore through \"Nobody Love,\" her debut album's first single, and delivered what was generally considered to be the show's most striking performance. Unbreakable Smile's release a month later was proof of the broadcast's power \u2014 the LP debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and \"Nobody Love,\" which peaked inside Billboard's Top 20, was certified gold. By pairing an enduring singer-songwriter sound with more explosive tracks like \"Expensive,\" Kelly honored her most devoted fans while opening herself up to a more mainstream audience.\n\"Should've Been Us,\" released next, also went gold.\nAs pop began to embrace Kelly's relaxed attitude and penchant for producing radio-worthy hits, she reminded everyone with a tribute to Smokey Robinson at the 2015 BET Awards that she was, at her core, a soul artist. Fans \u2014 old and new \u2014 went wild on Twitter after her rendition of \"Who's Lovin You.\" Even Snoop Dogg, who watched the", "gen_completion": " televised event from the comfort of his home in Los Angeles, came close to singing along to the rapper's hit \"Run This Town.\" And this is where the real love of Kelly's career began to blossom.\nAs Kelly became one of the most in-demand songwriters around, there was one other artist who made her feel like she was the one in control. Back in 2014, New Zealand's Kaytranada made his big break with a collaboration with Kanye West for his Yeezus album. In 2016, he became the first artist to be included on the coveted Billboard Hot 100 top 10, finishing at No. 3. Last November, he scored his biggest hit yet \u2014 a No. 1 single with Justin Bieber \"Stitches\" \u2014 thanks in large part to Kelly.

But when things go sour -- you get harassed online, you post something controversial or you otherwise get the Internet mad at you -- those stated rules of community courtesy become some of your greatest tools.\nSo it makes sense, then, that you should actually be able to understand them, right?\nThe makeover comes shortly after the company unveiled the design of its data use policy and privacy menus to be more friendly to its growing (and, often, aging) userbase.\nThis is almost entirely a cosmetic change, the company said. \"We're not changing anything about the policies,\" said Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of global policy management. \"We're just trying to explain what we do more clearly.\"\nPreviously, Facebook's Community Standards page was serviceable -- a single page that you could scroll through to find the policy that you wanted to peruse. It wasn't hard to navigate, but it wasn't easy either.\nNow, the baseline rules of conduct on Facebook are grouped into four categories -- such as \"Keeping you safe\" -- that aim to make it easier to find a policy on a particular subject and offer a little more about Facebook's policies.\nThe new design also includes descriptions of existing policy that Facebook hasn't put in its community standards before, but do explain how the company currently operates, Bickert said.\nFor example, there's a section now in the community standards that explains how the company deals with \"Dangerous Organizations,\" which makes it clear that Facebook doesn't allow \"terrorist activity\" or \"organized criminal activity\" to have a place on its site. The company had broadly covered that prohibition in its previous standards, but decided it was worth explaining a little more deeply in the new format. Facebook has also broken out a section detailing \"Attacks on Public Figures.\"\nBickert said that the company wanted to keep the language as simple as possible since the community standards are universal across the company's approximately 1.3 billion users -- covering Facebookers of all ages, on all platforms and in all of the countries where the network reaches.

According to reports, the compromise bill was presented to the General Assembly before the conference committee even met, causing some more knowledgeable about Harrisburg politics than this writer to speculate about who had actually authored the pro-gas industry legislation.\nLeft in the dark? Maybe, \u2014 or maybe it was just the industry\u2019s investment in Pennsylvania politics paying off.\nAccording to Common Cause and the Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, the natural gas industry has spent over $29 million dollars in campaign contributions and lobbying efforts in this state during the past dozen years. Top recipients of industry money given between 2000 and April 2012 included Gov. Corbett with $1,813,205.59, Senate President Joseph Scarnati (R-northcentral PA) with $359,145.72, Rep. Dave Reed (R-Indiana) with $137,532.33, House Majority Leader Rep. Mike Turzai (R-Allegheny) with $98,600, and Sen. Don White (R-Indiana & parts of 4 other counties) with $94,150. Jake Corman (R-Centre) accepted $91,290. Of the top 50 political recipients, 34 were Republicans and 16 were Democrats.\nThe Supreme Court ruling struck down three sections of Act 13. Section 3215(b)(4) required the Department of Environmental Protection to waive setbacks for drilling activities from streams, lakes and wetlands as long as a driller submitted a plan purportedly showing that those waters would be protected. Section 3303 established statewide rules for oil and gas activities irrespective of existing or future local zoning rules. Section 3304 required municipalities to allow oil and gas development activities in all zoning areas.\nThe court\u2019s ruling is significant in that it nullified these three provisions of Act 13, but even more so because of the court\u2019s reason for doing so. In the 162-page decision, Chief Justice Ronald D. Castille referred many times to Article 1, Section 27, of the Pennsylvania Constitution \u2014 often called the Environmental Rights Amendment.\nCastille noted that Pennsylvania \u201chas a notable history of what appears retrospectively to have been a shortsighted exploitation of its bounteous environment.\u201d He did not want to see that repeated.\nIn a phone interview late last week, John Quigley commented about the importance of the", "gen_completion": " court ruling to the industry.

And we've seen that you are what you like on Facebook \u2014 a computer algorithm based on \"likes\" can home in on such things as sexual orientation, political leanings and psychological traits including openness and conscientiousness.\nSo, think of your Facebook page as Stuart Smiley's mirror: It contains a lot of your core beliefs and preferences, and it puts your network of friends and family at your reach. In psychologist language, it can \"satisfy fundamental ego needs regarding desired self-images.\"\nYou can't directly measure any Facebook bump in self-esteem or any bump generated other ways. But you can measure defensive behavior to criticism. It's been shown that the self-affirmation experiences similar to those spoofed by Stuart Smiley reduce defensive responses that are naturally elicited by ego threats.\nPsychologists have tested this repeatedly. Usually they ask a participant to list strongly held beliefs and write an essay about the top one. After that, the participant invariably reacts better to a blow against the ego. The essay acts as self-affirmation.\nThe participant who chooses to write about a lower-ranked value but about how others may think it's important generally is more defensive. The essay had no self-affirming effect.\nTurns out, looking at your own Facebook page is the social network equivalent of that first essay. Looking at another person's page is the non-affirming experience.\nCatalina Toma, at the University of Wisconsin, and Jeffrey Hancock, at Cornell, study communication and social networks. They devised two experiments. In the first, some students got to look at their own Facebook page, while others looked at a stranger's page (it turned out to be another study participant's page). Some wrote the self-affirming essay, while others wrote the more neutral one.\nNow the ruse: Participants were told they were there to evaluate a distance-learning public speaking course. Each was to write a short speech on the legality of abortion and deliver it to a camera, then get feedback and rate the feedback by various aspects. The trick: Participants wound up with the same negative feedback.\nWhat happened? Results were as expected: less defensive response from people exposed to self-affirmation activity; more from those who did not get that experience. And it turned out that the proportion between those two responses was the same for those who wrote the essays as for those who viewed Facebook pages.\n\u201cFacebook has just as big an effect on self-esteem as traditional tools,\u201d Hancock said.\nBut would someone who gets a negative feedback actively seek solace in Facebook? The second experiment tested that. They used a similar cover story: testing a public speaking program. But this time feedback was randomly negative or neutral. After the feedback, participants were allowed to choose an activity: looking at their own Facebook page, watching YouTube videos, listening to online music, reading online news or playing online video games.\nAfter receiving neutral feedback, participants were equally likely to choose any of", "gen_completion": " the four, or the all of the other options. But when either received the negative or neutral feedback, they tended to get more defensive, according to Hancock's findings. He also found that being confronted by a stranger with self-affirmation activity (even when it was directed at you) increased the likelihood of having to defend one of the other options.\nToma said her more critical participants \u2014 maybe those who were more likely to self-belate in the first experiment \u2014 had been more likely to defend themselves in the second.\n\"That self-affirmation and defensive behavior seems to have an association with the content of the communication,\u201d she said. She thinks people react more negatively to negative feedback because they expect it to elicit a negative response, too.\nTommi said her study results, combined with ones about other studies, suggest some form of feedback may be working with Facebook to encourage defensive behavior.

It's the kind of thing you should never tamper with. And it should obviously remain heavily guarded.\nBut Macs purchased one year ago or before, apparently, leave a door open.\nWhen a Mac goes into sleep mode and wakes back up, it allows direct access to the BIOS. It's a weird quirk that lets someone tamper with the code there.

An attacker first needs administrative access to a machine.

{"prefix": "Recently, I was gifted with a little bottle of blessed oil brought from an orthodox monastery in Greece. The aroma of this blessed oil is powerful, profound and, yes, mystical.\nObviously, when I say mystical, I am not talking about esotericism. The joint document, entitled \"Jesus Christ the Bearer of the Water of life: A Christian reflection on the 'New Age'\" issued by the Pontifical Council for Culture and the Pontifical Council for interreligious Dialogue, describes it as \"a search for knowledge, and magic, or the occult\". On the contrary, what is mystical is revealed because it is not the theoretical knowledge for the chosen few but holiness as the everyday bread and butter for every person. As Jesus himself tells us: \"Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven \"(Matt 5:19). Therefore, Christian mysticism is about being great and not being small. It is about being authentic and not fake by placing oneself above others.\nThe bible teaching which tells us that you and me, thanks to Jesus' Spirit in us that we received both at our baptism and at our confirmation, lives in us, is found in Paul's Second Letter to the Corinthians. Here Paul says: \"But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?\" (2 Cor 2:14-16).\nBoth Jesus Christ and Satan have their aroma. The aroma of Jesus Christ is \"love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control\" (Gal 5:22-23). Moreover, the Bible tells us that Christ's aroma is also compassion, \"kindness, lowliness, meekness,... patience,... forgive[ness],... perfect harmony,... love,... thankful[ness], teach[ing], admonish[ing] one another,... do[ing] everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, [and] giving thanks to God the Father through him\" (Col 3:12-17).\nAlmost every person I anoint and pray over with this blessed oil tells me: \"Father! What a nice smell this oil has!\" You are hundred per cent right my dear brother and sister! Because, if you and I carry within our hearts love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, patience, forgiveness, perfect harmony, thankfulness, teaching, admonishing one another gently, doing everything in the name of the Lord Jesus and giving thanks to God the Father through Him we certainly smell beautiful. The reason is that it is no longer our weak smell of sin that we carry in our hearts but Christ's fragrance. And, when you and I let God's Spirit live in us and cultivate within us these holy and beloved attitudes then Jesus can look at us and say to us personally: \"How sweet is your love, my sister, my bride! How much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice\" (Cant 4:10).\nYes!

Remember, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit live within us, in the Eucharistic Body and blood of the Lord.

Let us have confidence that Jesus Christ's fragrance, the aroma of Our Holy Spirit, can awaken in us the desire to make Him known by way of our deeds and words. Let us also be willing, even today, to live our lives so as to bless the Holy Spirit's gift of the Eucharistic Body and blood to others.

{"prefix": "Like other public organizations, fire and emergency medical services are going through a number of major changes to keep up with the needs and demands of local municipalities. New models are emerging to meet the changing times.\nOne of these models is community paramedicine, which in essence allows EMS personnel to visit the homes of individuals who require medical assistance. These individuals are not medical emergencies that require transportation to a hospital emergency room.\nFor years, 911 calls from individuals who needed medical attention but are not emergencies have overburdened EMS units. These calls created a number of patient care problems and strained hospital ER services.\nCommunity paramedicine is designed to address these issues. Numerous articles and studies cite the overall benefits of this model, showing how in the long run, non-emergency patients need fewer trips to the ER.\nHowever, ER services are again under stress due to the current nationwide opioid crisis. Emergency medical services must respond to countless overdose calls that burden EMS workers and take away necessary resources from other emergencies.\nA recent study shows that many overdose patients do not get the care that they need to break the cycle, even after one or more emergency trips to a medical facility. However, an interesting new measure has emerged that meets the need to help drug overdose patients.\nAccording to Dan Swayze, community paramedicine can be used to monitor opioid-addicted patients detoxing at home. Swayze says a couple of cities are starting to use this model, which could be a boon to the community and potentially reduce the number of opioid-related drug overdoses.\nEmergency medical services will continue to change as the needs of local municipalities change.

According to a Reuters report, production of the company's solar tiles have been delayed by assembly line problems.\nPart of the issue is producing tiles that meet the aesthetic standards of company CEO, Elon Musk.\nUPDATE: Aug. 13, 2018, 9:03 a.m. CEST A Tesla spokesperson told Mashable that there are no problems with the product's looks. \"The claim of a former employee that Solar Roof is delayed due to aesthetics is false. We are ramping the production and installation of Solar Roof substantially,\" the spokesperson told us via email.\nAnnounced in October 2016, Tesla's Solar Roof tiles are advertised as a beautiful, durable alternative to regular roof tiles that also happen to produce electricity to power your home. But the production at Tesla's Buffalo, New York plant that opened last year has been so slow that it forced Panasonic \u2014 Tesla's partner in this venture \u2014 to sell components it built for Tesla to other buyers. This is according to unnamed current and former Panasonic employees as well as a former Tesla employee.\nAnother former Tesla employee told Reuters that the aesthetic look of the tiles, which is not always up to par with Musk's standards, is the \"big issue\" here. According to Reuters' sources, only one out of four versions of the Solar Roof tile \u2014 the black-textured one \u2014 has been produced so far.\nThe black-textured Solar Roof tile (pictured) is the only one Tesla has produced so far, the report claims.\nIn a response to Reuters, Tesla said it's working to improve production output but declined to give any exact figures. \"We are steadily ramping up Solar Roof production in Buffalo and are also continuing to iterate on the product design and production process.

Missouri&apos;s Republican legislative leaders have said there&apos;s little chance for any expansion this year.\nAs part of the federal Affordable Care Act, states that expand Medicaid coverage for families and individuals making up to 138 percent of federal poverty can receive more federal funding.\nCurrently, able-bodied adults without children do not qualify for Medicaid in Missouri. Parents making less than about 19 percent of federal poverty, or $3,612 for an adult with two children, do qualify.\nMany working Missourians fall into what Silvey and others call a coverage gap, making too little to qualify for subsidies to pay for insurance through a government exchange, but too much to qualify for Medicaid. This includes working age adults under 65 making less than $11,670 for a single person.\nSilvey said early estimates were at least 22,000 spouses of veterans would qualify for Medicaid under the proposal.\nDewey Riehn, Veterans of Foreign Wars legislative chairman, said expansion would benefit many veterans and their families.

{"prefix": "There was much to be disappointed by in President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview over the weekend, from his curious belief that climate change might reverse itself to his contention that his mocking of alleged sexual assault victim Christine Blasey Ford is immaterial now that \u201cwe won\u201d and Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court. But there\u2019s at least one thing he said that ought to disturb Americans right in their core beliefs. Asked about the apparent murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, President Trump vowed \u201csevere punishment\u201d if it turns out that Saudi Arabia ordered his death, but he expressed great reluctance to use the most powerful leverage available to him \u2014 the pending $110 billion arms sale to that country \u2014 on the grounds it would hurt U.S. manufacturers.\nSo there it is. The price of justice has been set. Do at least $110 billion worth of business with a favored industry within the United States and human rights are meaningless. Truth is meaningless. Once again, the Saudi royal family is demonstrating to the world that everyone has a price. The values that Americans claim to hold dear are actually negotiable when contracts and jobs are on the line. No wonder China and Russia and other regimes with questionable human rights records want to do business with the U.S. We are a paper tiger made from greenbacks. Lock us into enormously valuable contracts, and we\u2019ll purr like kittens.\nMight it be too early to judge the Trump administration morally bankrupt when the matter hasn\u2019t been fully investigated? Perhaps. But President Trump doesn\u2019t exactly have a sterling record for investigations, given the FBI\u2019s recent whitewash of Professor Ford\u2019s alleged teen encounter with Judge Kavanaugh, neither of whom federal gumshoes could be bothered to interview. What similar treatment is waiting for the case of the missing Washington Post columnist? Rounding up the usual suspects? Blaming MS-13? You don\u2019t have to be a Democrat to be appalled by this administration\u2019s tolerance of Saudi misconduct. Congressional Republicans are grumbling about the response, too \u2014 including Sen. Marco Rubio who was on TV Sunday saying neither Saudi money nor its occasional help reining in Iran should cause the U.S. to lose sight of its role as a defender of morality and human rights.\nIndeed, congressional action may ultimately be the only way to be certain a serious punishment is meted out against the Saudis \u2014 much as it took Congress to force the administration to keep pressure on Russia and Vladimir Putin. Mr. Trump\u2019s loyalties often seem to run toward making money and not toward defending this nation\u2019s ideals. He\u2019s only too willing to risk economic success in trade wars. He\u2019ll take that gamble in the name of greater economic success. But standing up for free speech? That\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem to be in the Trump DNA.

But Dr. Wladawsky-Berger didn't go out and spend a huge budget on specialized hardware. Rather, the genius of his approach was to take sets of already-manufactured processors -- at the time, RISC processors from IBM's Unix family -- and lashed them together with a high-speed switch to create supercomputing power. A few years later, the follow-on generation of supercomputers was built in a similar fashion from x86 processors running Linux.\nWelcome to innovation, 21st Century style.

{"prefix": "Warminster, Pa. - THE horticultural world is having its own debate over immigration, with some environmentalists warning about the dangers of so-called exotic plants from other countries and continents \"invading\" American gardens. These botanical xenophobes say that a pristine natural state exists in our yards and that to disturb it is both sinful and calamitous. In their view, exotic plants will swallow your garden, your neighbors' gardens and your neighbors' neighbors' gardens until the ecosystem collapses under their rampant suffocating growth.\nIf anything suffocates us, though, it will be the environmentalists' narrowmindedness. Like all utopian visions, their dream beckons us into a perfect and rational natural world where nothing ever changes -- a world that never existed and never will.\nNative plants are the survivalists of the botanical world, and in the appropriate settings -- wilderness areas, home and botanical gardens, public parks and sidewalks -- they bless us with their beauty and awe us with their tenacity. Our lives would be poor and grim without the strawberry, cranberry, columbine and trillium. They've always been here, in the same way that Native Americans have been; only their arrival and settlement are more ancient.\nLike human survivalists, natives are also subject to exploitation by the horticultural equivalent of radical fundamentalists. The anti-exotics argue that gardens should be populated exclusively by native plants, as if the exotics were trying to enter the flower bed illegally. The consequences of such a stand could be dire. Should we eat no onions or garlic, apples or lemons; feast our eyes on no magnificent tulips or roses -- all exotics of Eurasian origin? Should Asians not enjoy their distinctive peppers, tomatoes, beans, squash, sunflowers and corn -- all from the Americas?\nIndeed, the world's most popular root crop, potatoes, started life as a staple of the Andean people and achieved its first international fame as a slave food. By the time it reached France, the \"earth apple\" was a delicacy likened to truffles; their flowers were featured in tiaras of court ladies. Exotic indeed.\nShould we deprive ourselves of petunias, begonias, impatiens and hollyhocks -- not a one of them \"native\"? Must we, on pain of being cast out of the garden as horticultural pariahs, deny the elephant his peanuts? This wouldn't be merely ridiculous. It would compare with the denial of human immigration on grounds that certain ethnic groups breed in numbers \"too prolific\" for the existing elite to tolerate. Imagine, then, a horticultural ruling class. No \"invasives\" need apply: let the lily find another valley. Such prohibitions of exotic plant species demonstrate only an elitist snobbery that is as dangerous to a free society as it is to a free botany.\nNo one, and certainly no gardener, grows truly destructive invasive plants in his garden.

{"prefix": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi is probably the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back, but that doesn't mean it's without its faults. From the over the top barrage of humor to some certain things that made fans laugh or cry at the wrong time, we've collected some of the biggest gripes with Rian Johnson's first foray into the Star Wars universe. While they're not horrible offenses, they've for some reason or another left a bad taste in the mouths of fans, much like the weird green milk Luke Skywalker ingested on Ahch-To from that weird alien sea cow. Brace yourselves, there are SPOILERS AHEAD, so if you haven't seen The Last Jedi, you might want to stop reading.\nOne of the worst things about The Last Jedi are the Canto Bight scenes. They seem out of place, almost like George Lucas directed them and had the scenes patched into the movie without telling anybody. From a weird drunken space leprechaun feeding BB-8 gold coins to some of the lamest inhabitants of any alien planet in the Star Wars universe. It is definitely the bathroom break portion of the movie with the only saving grace being the introduction of Benicio del Toro's DJ character into the fold. Elsewhere, the Fathiers have weird almost human-like faces to prove how sad they are while some poor orphan kids clean up after them. Never mind BB-8 shooting gold coins out of himself like a bizarre machine gun. The whole scene that leads to Canto Bight turning into the nightmare of the movie is undoubtedly the parking violation. Rose and Finn get arrested for a Parking ticket? This can't be real and it truly looks like George Lucas wrote that into the script because it reeks of his style. Those fans griping that Lucas isn't represented in The Last Jedi, look no further than 2 main characters getting arrested for a parking violation at a casino. It's just plain lazy and not even humorous, except to maybe George Lucas.\nCaptain Phasma was promised to be a bigger character in The Last Jedi and she clearly was not. She's barely in the movie and when she is on the screen for a substantial amount of time, she apparently dies and we get to see her eye. There's no big reveal and she doesn't even seem as tough as she does in The Force Awakens, which basically means that she's another throwaway character who does all of the press and promotion for the movie, but is barely on the screen.\nAnother gripe about The Last Jedi is the lack of background on Supreme Leader Snoke. J.J. Abrams built the leader of the First Order to be this huge deal and Andy Serkis was telling anybody that would listen that the villainous alien is more powerful than Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine. While Snoke looks amazing and Serkis' portrayal of the character is commanding, the dude gets cut in half by Kylo Ren, really easily too. So here's this big bad villain that everybody has been wondering about for 2 years and now nothing. Just cut in half with no mention of anything else.\nOk, so this might be a bit controversial, but Leia using the Force to get", "gen_completion": " Luke's lightsaber after his and Rey's deaths?

Unfortunately, they seem to have lost that confidence and the narrative seems so discombobulated and unbelievable. For a \"cinematic universes\" movie, I can see where they might want to hide a few of these Easter eggs. However, this entire scene is very jarring to almost every Star Wars fan that was lucky and experienced The Last Jedi sooner than later.

But hey, some bloat is good bloat.\nApple is adding still more features to the already overbloated iTunes because, you know, it needs more bloat.\nThe latest update to the music music/video/movies/app manager and player \u2013 classically dubbed version 11.0.3 \u2013 includes a redesigned Mini Player, album art in Song View, support for multi-disc albums, and some search and performance enhancements. It isn't the major update we hope to see Cupertino make to this once-great platform, but, hey, at least it's not getting any worse.\nHere's a look at the newest features, to help you decide whether you want to download yet another Apple iTunes update.\nAlbum art in songs view.\nYou can now see all of your pretty album art on the left when in the Songs viewing mode.

Jeb Bush \u2014 the father of Florida\u2019s school accountability system \u2014 that Florida needs \u201cfewer tests\u201d and \u201cbetter tests\u201d as it moves forward.\n\u201cGiven the things that we don\u2019t know, and the time that\u2019s overtaken us, are we headed in the direction of fewer tests and better tests, and if so, when will we get there?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cIn order to have fewer tests, it will take legislative change,\u201d Stewart responded.\nAccording to the Department of Education, the number of hours students will spend on the state\u2019s main tests in many grades in 2014-15 is actually lower than the number of hours students faced seven years ago.

So, how do I break that and disrupt that by using the web?\u201d Those ideas later became AgLocal.\nHowever, Jones quickly realized that the consumer-focused approach which would allow everyday folks to buy directly from farms wouldn\u2019t work. It just wasn\u2019t scalable. \u201cPeople really don\u2019t buy that way, even when they say they will,\u201d he says. \u201cThey like to buy their meat in trusted places where it\u2019s stored cold \u2013 grocery stores and butcher shops.\u201d The other problem was that farms don\u2019t do business that way either \u2013 they don\u2019t deliver their meat throughout the city because they simply don\u2019t have time. Getting into the consumer market would mean turning into a supply chain company, Jones realized, and he didn\u2019t want that.\nInstead, he looked to who were the biggest buyers of meats, and decided to enable them. Here in the U.S., that\u2019s the distributor businesses which sells to the retailers. There are a number of these businesses which are independent (meaning not under contract from larger distributors like Monsanto or Cargill), but still fairly good-sized companies. Through AgLocal, they\u2019ll be able to connect with and buy directly from the farmers. And in the end, AgLocal could still offer consumers a mobile solution that lets them know where in their city they can find the locally raised, sustainable meats.\n\u201cSustainable,\u201d although not the original inspiration for the business, is a key part of AgLocal\u2019s potential. Explains Jones, most farmers have the ability to scale their farm up and produce 4 times what they do now, but they choose not to. The problem is that if they do, in order to maintain their margins, their only buyer is a Monsanto or C", "gen_completion": "argill or a small company that they choose to deal with. When they can sell to consumers directly, there\u2019s no risk or costs. The farmer can scale what they\u2019re doing, and consumers will be more inclined to continue purchasing sustainable meats because they know where their products have come from. And that, of course, will make them more sustainable and cost competitive.\nJones calls the AgLocal solution a sort of \u2018Amazon-for-farmers,\u2019 and it sounds to me like if you could turn your own backyard and eat organic greens, organic cheese, and organic meat sourced from a small herd of local, sustainable cows, it could be a very big deal for people and a huge business opportunity.\nAgLocal also has the advantage of being a mobile solution: On any iPhone or Android device (and I mean any mobile device) you just tap on the AgLocal logo and the site opens automatically.

{"prefix": "\"Breaking Bad\" spinoff \"Better Call Saul\" is coming to TV in Feb. and it's probably one of the most-anticipated new series of the year.\nWe've already seen it, and \"Breaking Bad\" fans should really enjoy it.\nSo it shouldn't be a big surprise the series has already been renewed for a second season.\nIf you can't wait for \"Better Call Saul,\" but need to know a bit more before the show's premiere, here's everything you need to know about the spinoff.\nIs this a prequel or a sequel?\nThe majority of the series is set in 2002, six years before Saul ever met Walter White. However, the show definitely has some elements of a sequel, too, as viewers will see in the premiere's first frew minutes.\nSo, yes, you'll get to see what became of Saul Goodman after he left Walt and Jesse Pinkman.\nWhen we spoke with Odenkirk a while back while he was doing press for his Oscar-nominated film \"Nebraska,\" the star told us he wanted the show to be both a prequel and sequel. It looks like he got his wish.\nWho will star in the spinoff?\nJonathan Banks will reprise his role as Mike Ehrmantraut.\nMichael McKean will play Saul's older brother Chuck who is a partner at a law firm in Albuquerque.\nPatrick Fabian plays Howard Hamlin while Rhea Seehorn (\"Whitney\") stars as Kim, two lawyers at Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill.\nMichael Mando (\"Orphan Black\") plays a criminal named Nacho Varga.\nSo, what will this be about?\nThe show will follow Saul Goodman before he's the cocky, confident lawyer, when he's just known as Jimmy McGill.\nMcGill's strapped for cash and drives a rundown car. He's trying to make a living as an honest attorney. What should follow in the series is how McGill goes from a scrappy, hungry young lawyer to a well-known name in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nWhy did Saul get his own spinoff?\nThe show has been in the works for a while in the \"Breaking Bad\" writers room. Creator Vince Gilligan told Hitfix it kind of started off as a joke.\nIt started as a lark, which is another word for joke, in the writer's room. It started and it really came from the fact that I love working with Bob, just as we love working with really every actor on \"Breaking Bad.\" But we also loved the character. We love writing for the character. We love putting words in his mouth. And we had so much fun indeed doing that that it started as a lark; we'd come up with some great term or phrase and we'd laugh about it in the writer's room. And then we'd say, 'You know, when we're doing the Saul Goodman show we'll be able to blah, blah, blah, blah.' And we made that comment so many times that it started to dawn on us that it wasn't a lark; there was truth to it. It was not just a joke, but a potentially good idea.\nIf I like \"Breaking Bad,\" will I enjoy it?\nI think you will. From what I've seen in the first two episodes (I'm waiting out to watch the third at the moment), there are plenty of nods to the original series while not feeling forced.\nYou'll see a few familiar faces including Jonathan Banks, and the visuals and montages will feel straight out of \"Breaking Bad.\"\nHowever, don't go into this show wanting another \"Breaking", "gen_completion": " Bad\" in your life.\nBreaking Bad was such a unique series; it's a show where you can really sink your teeth into all the characters and the details and the stories and just love them. But you know what I love about this show?\nI loved watching it. I loved watching it very intensely.\n\"Breaking Bad\" season one and the whole first season is available to stream now on Netflix.\n\"Better Call Saul,\" \"Breaking Bad\" season 3 premieres on Thursday, Feb. 1 at 10 p.m. ET/PT on AMC.\nThis story has been corrected to fix a previous version of the show's first episode's title when it takes place in 2002, rather than 2003, as originally stated.\nCopyright 2018 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and receive the latest local news and weather straight to your email every morning.\nGet the latest local news and weather straight to your email"}

But more importantly, the Wilson/Amendola deals are worth a combined $36 million, compared with $75 million for Landry.\nDefensively, Quinn didn\u2019t have a sack, but PFF ranked him fifth among all defensive ends in run defense through Sunday\u2019s games and the matchup was very competitive with Pro Bowl left tackle Taylor Lewan before Lewan left with a concussion in the second quarter.\nBoth Quinn and the other newcomer on the defensive line, Akeem Spence, were barreling in on Titans quarterback Blaine Gabbert before Gabbert\u2019s rushed screen pass was intercepted by Kiko Alonso.\nAs for Fitzpatrick, the rookie first-rounder shifted momentum when he pushed aside Rishard Matthews to stop Corey Davis on a fourth and goal, preventing a touchdown that would have put the Titans up 10-0.\nPFF said Fitzpatrick graded out the best of any Dolphins defender Sunday; he allowed just three completions in six attempts for 14 yards and had six tackles.\nMeanwhile, rookie linebacker Jerome Baker was decent, ranking the best of Miami\u2019s linebackers by PFF, 44th of 74 qualifiers.\nAnd a couple of other newcomers left positive impressions.\nRookie kicker Jason Sanders made both of his field goal attempts (", "gen_completion": "42, 39) for Miami \u2013 in his first two games as a starter.\nDefensive back Mike Williams was a bright spot for the Dolphins; he collected three passes defensed, four tackles, one interception and a kickoff return for a touchdown that could prove to be the play of the game or the drive of the game.\nRookie safety Bobby McCain, who joined the Dolphins at midseason after being claimed off waivers from Los Angeles, played well.

{"prefix": "A system that aims to identify stolen passwords before breaches are reported or even detected was launched on Tuesday.\nShape Security's Blackfish credential defence system is designed to detect the use of stolen usernames and passwords by criminals and in real time.\nThe technology is a mechanism for organisations to identify the abuse of stolen passwords and attempts to hijack accounts long before these same purloined credentials show up for sale on the dark web.\nCybercrooks regularly automate the process of testing stolen or leaked passwords on third-party websites.\nFor example, customers of online takeaway firm Deliveroo found their accounts hijacked and charged for food they never ordered because of a credential-stuffing attack. In another attack using the same method, passwords and email addresses from previous breaches were abused to gain access to 26,000 online UK National Lottery accounts. Groupon blamed fraudulent purchases from some UK customers' accounts on password leaks from other sites.\nCredential stuffing only works because many users still use the same login details on multiple sites. This is a serious security risk that's only getting worse as the volume of data breaches rises.\nShape Security's network data shows that in many industries, such as retail, more than 90 per cent of all login attempts to websites often come from credential-stuffing attacks instead of genuine users.\nShape Security's customer base includes three of the top-four banks, four of the top-five airlines, two of the top-five hotel chains, and two of the top-five US government agencies. Crowdsourcing alerts about brute-force credential-stuffing attacks among its customers makes for an effective early warning system, the firm claims.\nCTO and former Google clickfraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder told El Reg: \"Cybercriminal organizations are businesses, and they need an ROI, so it just doesn't make sense for them to go after smaller websites with credential-stuffing campaigns. Over the last five years, Shape has created and deployed technology to protect the login systems of the major banks, airlines, retailers, and other industries where cybercriminals first use stolen credentials to take over accounts.\n\"So in this case there isn't much of a 'long tail' associated with the attack data, since cybercriminal activity is concentrated in the high end of the market.\"\nFacebook, Twitter and other companies have been researching the dark web for several years, acquiring lists of stolen credentials to protect their users. \"This can be helpful but its utility is limited,\" said Gh", "gen_completion": "osemajumder, author of the book \"Best of Attack Patterns\". \"The big difference in how we approach this problem is the use of automation to scan millions of accounts for credentials and then put all these accounts on monitoring, and the use of automation to identify patterns of attack.\"\nAnother Shape Security senior vice president Mike Rix told El Reg: \"This is obviously the second of two phase of the attack. Phase one is stealing data, then use of the information. Phase two is leveraging the stolen credentials to make money from your credentials. If you are not monitoring, it won't matter if there was a hack because they will only need to breach a single organization before they have access to your whole infrastructure.\"\nShape is also developing Blackfish to detect and block the behaviour of credential thieves before these same stolen credentials do damage.\nRix added: \"It's like a virus for credentials\u2026 If they can steal credentials, that's one thing.

After all, users who are happy with unlimited 480p video might also want the same video quality across the board, so that even non-participating video sources consume less data.\nThe problem is that T-Mobile hasn\u2019t been up-front about its policies, so users can\u2019t make an informed decision.

Boras, however, claimed that he is in Libya and is ready to become part of the political process - an announcement that stirred mixed reactions within Libya.\nMohammad al-Darrat, a member of the Tobruk-based Libyan House of Representatives (HoR), told Al Jazeera that Saif al-Islam's intention to run does not deserve any attention, asserting that the Gaddafis' regime is gone for good.\n\"If Saif al-Islam wants to return to power, what was the point of the revolution?\" said al-Darrat.\nHe added that international and regional powers are not interested in supporting his return since the former regime is gone and the world \"believes in interests rather than individuals\".\nPolitical analyst Kamel al-Merash thinks otherwise. He believes that not all Libyans can be put in one basket, arguing that while some oppose Saif al-Islam's plan to run, others support it.\nAl-Merash said no regional forces back Saif al-Islam directly but added that some would not object to a potential candidacy due to his popularity within Libya.\nSaleh Afihima, a member of the HoR and a supporter of \"Operation Dignity\" led by renegade General Khalifa Haftar, agrees with al-Merash.\nHe believes that no one can deny Saif al-Islam's constitutional right as a Libyan citizen, so long as there are no judicial restrictions to prevent him from running.\nIn 2013, a law was passed banning Gaddafi-era officials from holding public office.

The objective of the game is to click only on the positive words, such as \"secure,\" \"joy,\" \"radiant,\" \"unity,\" \"serenity,\" and \"boost.\"\n\"You get points when you click on the positive words,\" explained Austin. \"Each time you play a game, the bar fills up with more points.\"\nThe students say they enjoy using Happify and don't find it difficult to navigate. \"I think it's easy to use and it's fun because some of the games are stress relievers,\"", "gen_completion": " said Austin.

Linganore then tried to ice the junior kicker with another timeout before Spath drilled the kick through to give Franklin the crown.\nFranklin coach Anthony Burgos knew that it might come down to Spath trying a field goal in the final moments and wanted the offense to get the ball in his range.\nThe Indians moved the ball well enough on the ground and in the air on offense, and their defense slowed a Linganore attack that scored 45 points in the first half of the state semifinal against Chesapeake-Anne Arundel last week.\nHowever, both teams had problems with mistakes in a game that was delayed more than a half hour due to traffic delays in the Annapolis area. Franklin quarterback Vernon Brown was picked off three times and nearly had a fourth one intercepted, but none led to points for Linganore.\nBut the Lancers also kept hurting themselves and they missed on a number of scoring chances. Linganore fumbled at the Franklin 1-yard line, had a field goal attempt bang off the crossbar and made it into Indian territory eight times but scored only twice.\nBoth teams moved the ball well in the first quarter, but Linganore took a 7-0 lead when quarterback Ryan Leyh floated a pass to Davon Butler on the left side, and he raced for a 34-yard touchdown.\nLeyh got the ball just over leaping linebacker Wayne Brooks on the side, and Butler easily scored with 1:52 left in the quarter.

{"prefix": "When I reflect on my childhood baking memories, one that stands out is a tray of warm chocolate chip cookies coming out of the oven. It was so tempting to eat the raw dough while making them \u2014 talk about a lesson in delayed gratification \u2014 but in 20 or so minutes, delicious buttery, sugary cookies dotted with chocolate chips would be ready to enjoy.\nNever mind fancy desserts; chocolate chip cookies have always been one of my favorite treats. And if you are like me and find them irresistible, you probably can\u2019t stop after a few bites.\nThen there\u2019s the chocolate, which, in addition to sugar, contains small amounts of a compound known as anandamide. Interestingly, anandamide is also a brain chemical that targets the same cell receptors as THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the active ingredient in marijuana that is responsible for its mood-altering effects. That\u2019s not to say chocolate will produce the same \u201chigh\u201d as marijuana, but there may be a chemical basis for the pleasure we get from eating chocolate.\n\u201cA chocolate chip cookie is a brilliant contrast among the flavors and among the textures,\u201d said Gail Vance Civille, founder and president of Sensory Spectrum, a consulting firm that helps companies learn how sensory cues drive consumer perceptions of products.\nThe flavor of chocolate chip cookies, according to Civille, is \u201ca beautiful amalgam of caramelized butter and sugar,\u201d the result of the browning of butter and caramelizing of sugar while it bakes. The combination of the toasted grain with the browned butter, caramelized sugar, vanilla and chocolate are \u201cthe beautiful rich flavors that blend together in a chocolate chip cookie,\u201d she said. And as the chocolate melts, it becomes more aromatic and punches up the flavor.\nThe texture of chocolate chip cookies also plays a big role in their appeal. \u201cJust on the texture side, [the chocolate chip cookie] has a lot going for it,\u201d Civille said.\n\u201cEvery bite will be interesting. \u2026 You will hit the cookie, which has crispness due to air pockets in the cookie crumb, and then the chocolate, which is dense and uniform when you bite through it. It\u2019s like a symphony orchestra playing together. \u2026 It\u2019s very harmonious,\u201d she said.\nOne of the simplest ways to test whether the flavor and texture of chocolate chip cookies are \u201caddictive enough\u201d is to observe people eating them.\n\u201cWhen I would create any product, if I put it out as a sample to my staff", "gen_completion": " or employees, people would come home with tons of cookies,\u201d Vance Civille said. \u201cSo I would always say, \u2018When are you going to go ahead and eat one [cookie], before I ask you whether you would buy it?\u2019\n\u201cThe big sign-up is when the employees would say, \u2018One bite was okay. Two bites was good. Three bites was good. But it\u2019s too good to be true,\u201d she said.\nAnd the same goes for alcohol. If people don\u2019t consume enough, their brain may not learn to detect the pleasantness of the drink, Civille said. \u201cIf they consume a lot, their brain will start to associate the pleasantness with alcohol.\u201d But when people consume enough, the brain can learn a new, pleasant combination of flavors and a new feeling akin to intoxication.\nAnother lesson to learn in the art of chocolate chip cookies is to avoid eating"}

{"prefix": "There have been in recent times, several reports of security personnel engaging in deviant behaviours that get us wandering if we are ever going to be safe.\nSecurity men have been cited in incidents of armed robbery, maiming and cold-blooded murder. These are not normal behaviors. That persons who the state has provided weapons for to protect society, turn these weapons on the very society that pays them as well, should be of serious concern to all of us. Not even when they turn the guns on themselves. Not only is it a waste of the country's resources; every single life lost is one life too many for this country.\nThe tragic incident that occurred close to the Castle, where an officer who was to secure the seat of the Presidency, turned his gun on civilians, before committing suicide must get us doing some serious thinking.\nThe questionable acts that some of our men and women in uniform involve themselves in, raise questions as to how we recruit these persons. For persons who we would entrust our very lives and safety with, there is the need to have established their psychological state.\nResilience is a very important asset that every security person must necessarily possess. Even though there is no art to tell the mind's construction in the face, as Shakespeare tells us, we are fortunate to have psychological tests that can determine one's state, and the potential to withstand or crumble under stress or provocation.\nThe line between sanity and insanity is so thin that most of us at one time or the other cross over to the other side. However, it is the frequency at which we do this and the intensity or duration of it, that indicates whether we need help or not.\nIn some jurisdictions, it is ensured that persons who belong to an elite force, undergo specialized examination and training in order to guarantee that guns are not handed over to persons with a high potential to rob, maim or kill. Such persons are at times even set apart from the rest of society, to insulate them from the pressures and stress the wider society faces.\nWe have been told about the existence of a special VIP protection unit within the security service. We are aware that the Castle is a VIP location, and therefore assume that personnel there would belong to this specialized unit of the service.

{"prefix": "Council Post: Can Advertisers Balance Scale And Quality?\nCan Advertisers Balance Scale And Quality?\nFounder and CEO of Taykey, a real-time audience data company.\nIn the wake of several high-profile cases of large advertisers appearing next to terrorist videos, the issues of inventory quality and safety are once again top of mind for the advertising industry. We\u2019re seeing a renewed flight to manually vetted solutions such as private ad exchanges, predefined publisher whitelists and traditional direct media deals where marketers run exclusively on hand-selected publishers.\nUnfortunately, advertisers also pay the price in the form of reduced scale, efficiency, and the ability to reach and engage their consumers most effectively. While the appeal of these manual approaches is understandable, their trade-offs are often unnecessary based on the advertiser\u2019s objectives. Increasingly, whitelisting and private exchanges are being used as a crutch for bad data and inaccurate targeting rather than a proactive strategy.\nThe primary challenge is consumer behavior itself. More than 30% of web traffic is driven by social media. Millennials check their phones more than 150 times per day, jumping from social platforms to articles to videos. Most of this phone time is \u201clife in the feed,\u201d where discovery reigns supreme and social conversation is driving consumption. As a result, the new prime time looks less like \"M*A*S*H*\" and more like Joseph Garrett (aka Stampy), who makes humorous Minecraft videos in his basement in the U.K. and has amassed more than 8.4 million global followers.\nBut that isn\u2019t typically how content targeting is approached when humans take the wheel. It\u2019s driven by broad category-level approaches and the gut instinct of the buyer rather than real-time consumer insight. Still, every advertiser has a right not to run next to ISIS videos. But most things aren\u2019t ISIS. They\u2019re Bill O\u2019Reilly, Kendall Jenner and PewDiePie -- safe territory that has suddenly become toxic -- and manual targeting approaches will leave you chasing your tail here, too.\nLuckily, with the right tools, the massive and growing volume of conversation data across social platforms and websites can be mined via natural language processing (NLP) to tell advertisers exactly what content consumers do care about in the moment, repeatedly and at massive scale. Speaking of Kendall Jenner and Bill O'Reilly, the same NLP technology would have automatically flagged these topics as controversial (based on sentiment detection) and instructed automated buying systems to avoid them as soon as the controversies erupted. The right tech can actually turn the challenge of consumer fragmentation into an opportunity, by leveraging the growing volume of social conversation to map consumer interests and align targeting accordingly.\nIn fact, we recently developed a product offering that connects NLP directly to real-time media buying decisions. We've seen this capability become increasingly valuable as audience attention continues to become more dynamic and unpredictable. For example, a men's magazine recently did an exclusive interview with Brad Pitt that went viral with women 25-", "gen_completion": "to-49 as being the top target demographic for the brand while men 20-to-39 fell off in relevance. This is just one example where automated data capture is helping advertisers reach their specific audience and achieve more at scale.\nBut like everything else, we still have to learn to turn this technology into a smart, cost-effective and scalable solution that solves the key operational challenges of scale and efficiency. As a pioneer in AI and machine learning, we are now leveraging these capabilities to solve a few of these challenges. Our goal is to take our NLP technology and apply it to any media buying challenge.\nAs we move closer to launching our product, we see many of the challenges mentioned above being handled in the same way: a data-driven approach that relies on a system to parse streams of text and take action based on what the buying systems are anticipating. The problem with this approach is it can quickly lead to problems. A retail giant that buys ads for an exclusive men's accessory"}

{"prefix": "Pension ULIPs offered by insurance companies are tailored to the needs of investors to accumulate their retirement corpus. They are similar to regular ULIPs in terms of nature and cost structure. Both have a lock-in of five years and the premiums paid are tax exempt under Section 80C up to \u20b91,50,000 annually.\nPension ULIPs are long-term investment products working in two phases: 1) accumulation and 2) income.\nDuring the accumulation phase, you can build your retirement corpus by investing in different asset classes. They levy various charges towards premium allocation, policy administration and switching. As mandated by the insurance regulator, pension ULIPs should guarantee at least the total premium paid by the policyholder at the time of pay out. For this, an investment guarantee charge is levied by the insurers ranging from 0.10 to 0.50 per cent per annum. Some insurers levy mortality charge calculated on the sum at risk. On death, the nominee would receive the higher of the fund value or 105 per cent of the total premiums paid so far. The nominee would be given the option to either withdraw totally or purchase an annuity product from the same insurer.\nOn completion of the policy term, the policyholder will receive the maturity proceeds (vesting benefit) \u2014higher of the fund value or at least 101 per cent of the total premium paid. As per the current regulations, one can withdraw one-third of the maturity proceeds as lumpsum, which is tax-free. The balance must be converted into an \u201cannuity\u201d that is offered by the same insurer. The payments from annuity are taxable as per the policyholder\u2019s tax bracket.\nHDFC Life Click 2 Retire is an online pension ULIP. The premiums collected are invested in two funds \u2014 pension equity plus and pension income fund \u2014 in certain proportion, as prescribed by HDFC Life. Here, the limitation is that the policyholder has no right to choose the fund option. The proportion of allocation is based on the policy term chosen. For instance, for the 35-year term, the allocation to equity fund in the first year is 80 per cent and 77 per cent in the second year. In the 20th and 30th years, the allocation to equity fund will be 29 and 2 per cent respectively. The allocation towards income fund increases as you near the maturity date.\nHDFC Life Click 2 Retire is cheaper than other pension ULIPs available in the market. The premium allocation and policy administration charges are nil. The fund management charge is 1.35 per cent of the fund value. The average expense ratio of the direct and regular plans of the balanced mutual funds were at 1.2 and 2.3 per cent (as of February 2018). About 0.5 per cent per annum is levied (on fund value) as investment guarantee charge across the policy term. This is higher relative to some other pension ULIPs that levy the charge only on the sum at risk. That means they charge nothing if fund value exceeds the total premium paid.\nOn death, the higher of the fund value or the 105 per cent of the total premiums paid so far is given. The nominee can either withdraw this amount as lumpsum or purchase an annuity product from HDFC Life to get pension. On maturity, the policyholder is given higher of the fund value or assured vesting benefit. The latter ranges between 101 per cent and 135 per cent of the total premium paid, calculated based on the policy term and premium payment term.\nHDFC Life allows you to hold the maturity proceeds within the pension ULIP by", "gen_completion": " paying annual premiums.

A beneficiary can take a monthly pension if such a beneficiary is over the age of 65 years and earns less than INR 10 lakh per annum. The same beneficiary can also get an annual pension. However, if such a person is earning more than the maximum pension payout provided by HDFC Life\u2019s income annuity policy, he can borrow funds from the policyholder, which can allow him to earn interest while holding on to his interest-earning capital for retirement purposes.\nA policyholder can take three types of benefits from"}

Lynton Crosby\u2019s last text to me predicted that we were going to \u2018do well\u2019, which according to our expectations would mean a Conservative majority of more than 60. A late projection, based on data from the ground and Jim Messina\u2019s modelling, suggested we would win 371 seats, giving us a majority of 92. In the end, the Conservatives got their highest share of the vote since 1983, and more votes than Tony Blair managed in any of his elections, yet still we ended up with a hung parliament.\nSkilful leadership may deliver stability, but the absence of an overall majority means the nature of the Brexit deal the government negotiates is more uncertain. There has long been talk of a choice between \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 forms of Brexit, with the latter requiring membership of the EU\u2019s single market. Since that would involve accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, vast annual membership payments to the EU, and the continuation of free movement rules, people who voted to leave the European Union might wonder whether advocates of a \u2018soft\u2019 departure really do understand that Brexit means Brexit.\nBecause this election failed to produce the majority we needed, it is impossible to call the campaign anything but a failure. Before it began, we envisaged a return to traditional campaigning methods, with daily press conferences to scrutinise Labour and promote our policies. Theresa, never comfortable hogging the limelight, expected to make more use of her ministerial team. On the advice of the campaign consultants, and following opinion research that showed Theresa to be far more popular than the party or her colleagues, we eschewed our instincts. We were wrong to do so.\nMy biggest regret, however, is that we did not campaign in accordance with the insight that took Theresa to Downing Street in the first place. While the referendum result was undoubtedly an instruction for Britain to leave the EU, it was also a vote for change. One can disagree with Theresa\u2019s prescription \u2014 a strategic role for the state to broaden economic opportunity, a clampdown on corporate excesses, rights for workers, intervention in dysfunctional markets and, through school reform, house-building and tax policy, a determination to make Britain the world\u2019s Great Meritocracy \u2014 but it is very difficult to disagree with her diagnosis.\nThat is why the Conservative manifesto, which I authored jointly with the brilliant Ben Gummer, rejected \u2018untrammelled free markets\u2019 and \u2018selfish individualism\u2019, and declared that \u2018our responsibility to one another is greater than the rights we hold as individuals\u2019. I was surprised to read some commentators describe these statements as \u2018left-wing\u2019 when the manifesto was consciously Burkean in its style and substance. Burke\u2019s great revelation was that if we value something, we must be prepared to reform it in order to keep it. I fear the election will cause many to conclude that we should return to the modern consensus politics of pure social and economic liberalism, which I believe is one of the causes of the division we see in Britain today.\nThe manifesto was later written off as \u2018the worst in history\u2019. One of the criticisms is that, instead of offering voters giveaways and bribes, we spelt out where cuts would fall. While I accept that the manifesto might have been too ambitious, I worry that the implication of this argument is that politicians should not be straight with the electorate.\n", "gen_completion": "In reality, the Labour government has spent every election we are entitled to hold presenting a budget that leaves behind it a mountain of debt.

Meanwhile the national debt has rocketed to almost 100 per cent of the economy.\nThe manifesto offered to voters a new social contract, which promises to deliver extra payments to welfare benefits and tax credits, increased infrastructure spending on rail and buses, a new, more effective public spending watchdog and the right of the poor to be heard on taxation.

That time is over.\n\u201cThe system that was built after the war no longer works,\u201d she continued. The EU and nato are cracking under the weight of an increasingly divergent set of interests among their members.

The German Army is not yet prepared for such a scenario. Yet the more likely the scenario becomes, the more Germany needs to prepare for it.\nSince large portions of the plan were formulated two years ago, the strategists didn\u2019t factor in the presidency of Donald Trump. No doubt the military strategists now regard this scenario with greater urgency.\nThe fact that German planners are thinking this way shows we\u2019re entering a new era of German thinking.

When considering an mHealth weight loss program, healthcare practitioners should look for one that has many of the same elements as successful person-to-person individualized programs administered by healthcare professionals, which emphasize a calorie-controlled diet, physical activity, self-monitoring or recording food intake and physical activity in a paper or digital diary, personalized feedback and social support.\nPhysical activity \u2014While the majority of studies show that using an online program boosted physical activity more than not using one, there hasn\u2019t been enough research to show whether wearable physical activity monitoring devices actually help you move more.\nSmoking cessation \u2014Mobile phone apps using text messaging to help quit smoking can almost double your chances of quitting, but about 90 percent of people using these apps fail to quit smoking after six months.

{"prefix": "Richards Bay is joining other coastal cities and building a desalination plant to survive the crippling drought. By converting sea water into fresh, the plant will allow the town to tap into what engineers refer to as an \u201calmost infinite\u201d water resource.\nBut water and sanitation officials say the option is one of \u201clast resort\u201d and has come about because of slow work by the water department on other projects.\nThe water department\u2019s own plans show that desalination was seen as a last resort \u2013 becaue it is so expensive and uses so much electricity. Research by the Water Research Commission breaks this down: the City of Cape Town can produce water for R1.25 a kilolitre using a mix of water sources, while Rand Water in Gauteng can produce water for R2.50 per kilolitre.\nBut a large desalination plant along the coast produces water at anywhere between R5.80 and R8.30 per kilolitre.\nBig plants, such as the one being built in Lamberts Bay in the Western Cape, use huge amounts of electricity to remove salt from seawater so that it can be drunk safely. A conventional water treatment plant uses 0.3 kilowatt-hours of electricity to treat a cubic metre of water, while a desalination plant uses up to eight kilowatt-hours of electricity.\nIn its desalination strategy, the water department notes that while the process \u201ccould provide an unlimited resource of freshwater\u201d, it would only be considered after all other options. This is because of the escalating cost of electricity and the lack of a local desalination-plant industry and expertise.\nOther options would include, for instance, treating sewage water back to drinking water, a much cheaper process in terms of electricity and cost. An attempt to do this in Durban was rejected by the local community, which refused to drink the water on religious grounds. There is also the option of fixing old water infrastructure in municipalities, where up to a quarter of the water is lost through leaks.\nBut the decision to desalinate seems to be the result of delays to other infrastructure projects. An official at the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority says desalination \u201cwas always going to be the technology of choice, in the future\u201d. The statement is based on documents such as government\u2019s 2012 National Water Resource Strategy. This master plan looked at how much water each town and city needed, and how much the water department could supply up to 2035.\nFor most cities, water use was projected to outstrip supply before that date. In Johannesburg and Cape Town, that crunch would come before the end of this decade. For Durban and areas such as Richards Bay, people and industry were already using more water than was available by 2005.\nSolving that problem has been the job of the water department, through agencies such as the Tunnel Authority. Mega-projects, such as the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, fall under its purview. This critical scheme is half a decade behind schedule.\nAlthough there are 4 400 registered dams across South Africa, the country\u2019s water security relies on fewer than 50. Upgrades to these dams, such as that planned for the Tzaneen Dam in Limpopo, have been delayed by years or indefinitely postponed.

{"prefix": "A much-hailed law that restricted the opening of new stand-alone fast-food restaurants in one of the poorest sections of Los Angeles did not curb obesity or improve diets, a new study found.\nCity lawmakers passed the zoning ordinance in 2008 that limited the opening or expansion of fast-food outlets in a 32-square-mile area south of Interstate 10 that struggles with high obesity rates and other health problems.\nThe law, believed to be the first effort of its kind by a major city to improve public health, did not ban new eateries in strip malls.\nThe research by the Rand Corp. think tank found that obesity rates in South Los Angeles continued to rise after passage of the law.\n\"It had no meaningful effect,\" Rand senior economist Roland Sturm said. \"There&apos;s no evidence that diets have improved more in South LA. Obesity and overweight rates have not fallen.\"\nHealth experts said a single intervention would not reverse the obesity problem. People also have to exercise and make lifestyle changes, they said.\n\"It&apos;s not just about limiting unhealthy food, but increasing access to healthy food,\" said Alex Ortega, a professor of public health at the University of California, Los Angeles, who had no role in the study.\nRand researchers reviewed permits issued by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, which inspects food outlets. There were no licenses for stand-alone fast-food restaurants, but chains opened 17 new outlets in strip shopping centers and food courts in South Los Angeles from 2008 to 2012.\nAlmost half of the new food permits were for convenience stores that sell soda and junk food, the study found.\nResearchers also compared obesity rates in South Los Angeles and other parts of the county using surveys that asked residents to report their weight and eating habits.\nBefore the fast-food ordinance, 63 percent of South Los Angeles residents reported being overweight or obese compared to 57 percent in other parts of the county. Three years after the ordinance went into effect, 75 percent of South Los Angeles residents reported being overweight or obese compared to 58 percent in other parts of the county.\nSupporters said the ordinance worked because it prevented chains from opening new restaurants at major intersections with their own drive-thru windows and parking lots. They acknowledged it will take some time to see health gains but noted that the area has seen farmers markets and community gardens in recent years.\n\"We never said this ordinance was the silver bullet\" to solving the obesity problem, said Gwen Flynn of the Community Health Councils. \"As long as we can make sure people have more options, that&apos;s the important thing.\"\nCity Councilman Bernard Parks, who supported the zoning law, said he was hopeful that the area can attract more markets selling fresh food.\nThe ordinance was", "gen_completion": " written by a committee made up of architects, lawyers and city planners.

{"prefix": "To get across Dublin city from, for example, St Vincent\u2019s University Hospital on the southside to Beaumont on the northside or to Connolly in the west could take 30 minutes at a quiet time of the day. At rush hour, it could take double that or even more.\nWith that in mind, nursing organisations are asking why would the Government be looking for a provision in a controversial new contract that would allow nurses working in Dublin to be moved between locations on opposite sides of the capital during a single shift, given the practical difficulties that may present.\nNursing unions and public service management will on Tuesday attend the Labour Court in a bid to resolve differences on a new contract which have complicated and could even threaten the proposed settlement to the recent nurses\u2019 strike.\nThe introduction of a new contract formed a key element of the original Labour Court recommendation that led to the suspension of the strike.\nNurses had been seeking pay parity with other graduate-entry groups such as physiotherapists who, they maintained, earn about \u20ac7,000 a year more.\nUnder the proposals, a new enhanced nurse grade would be introduced to which nurses could migrate after three years. Those moving on to the new grade would receive a salary increase of \u20ac2,439 or 7.3 per cent. The deal would also see significantly more nurses qualifying for additional allowances. However, there were also to be new cost-saving measures in a new contract to offset the cost of the proposed deal which could run to \u20ac50 million by the end of 2020.\nThe Irish Nurses\u2019 and Midwives\u2019 Organisation (INMO) initially urged members to back the Labour Court recommendation. However, when the Government\u2019s contract proposals were leaked, they caused consternation.\nThe Irish Times reported at the beginning of March that the Government wanted provisions to transfer nurses between locations \u2013 potentially within a 40km radius \u2013 for weeks at a time or even within a single shift.\nThe Government proposals could also see nurses rostered to work shifts lasting four, six, eight, 10 or 12 hours.\nThe INMO had seen the new contract as a potential opportunity to modernise nursing practices. However, it contended the Government proposals would actually worsen existing working arrangements.\nThe proposals were rejected by both the INMO and Siptu.\nWhile Government representatives agreed to some changes in the proposals during direct talks with unions and at the Workplace Relations Commission, they insisted on retaining provision for the roster reforms and to move nurses between locations.\nThis is the impasse that the Labour Court will seek to break this week.\nThe question as to why the Government has insisted on such controversial changes which potentially could jeopardise an overall agreement has been debated widely in industrial relations circles in recent weeks.\nSome believe the Government\u2019s target in its contract proposals is not actually the nurses but rather the wider public service trade union movement.\nFrom the start of the process, the Government was determined a settlement to the nurses\u2019 dispute would not cause a breakdown in the existing public service accord, leading to a pay free-for-all across the State sector.\nHowever, the other public service unions have so far held off on launching their much-anticipated knock-on claims. But they have not gone away. They are watching developments very carefully to see how any eventual nurse settlement plays out.\nSo what will the nurses have to give in productivity or work-practice changes in return for additional payments?\nSome senior industrial relations figures believe the Government is sending a message to the broader public service union movement that if", "gen_completion": " the nurses strike, the Government will not negotiate at all in their interests.\nWhatever the outcome, Wednesday morning will provide a critical reminder of the significance of the nurses\u2019 dispute.\nAnd the nurses are unlikely to shy away from taking their case to Labour Court for several reasons.\nTheir initial strike two and a half weeks ago was not an unauthorised industrial action \u2013 there was legal guidance that the strike was in fact work-protected.\nThe Labour Court will accept that it was not an industrial action because the public service unions did their jobs. But it will not be comfortable accepting a claim that the nurses were unfairly treated.\nEmployers\u2019 legal representation may claim that if the nurses were being forced to transfer between locations each shift, their pay would not be affected.\nHowever, that point has not been made explicitly to the nurses during the collective bargaining process. But the nurses do expect to hear the Government\u2019s lawyers argue that these issues have been settled during the ongoing"}

No more time travelling - this is the period where the machines wake up, the human race hardens up, and the CIA stops pushing too many pencils. Terminator Salvation the game, is set just before the events of the movie, we reviewed it on PS3.\nTerminator is a 3rd person cover shooter that you can play solo or split screen with someone next to you. The machines have some heavy duty firepower, so you and your squad will need to rely heavily on shoot & move tactics, which suits the movies perfectly. Each new room will contain several bits of cover, a la Gears of War, and your health won't go back up until the firefight is over. If you're pinned down on 10% health with no ammo, you're already dead. You just don't know it yet.\nEmphasis is placed on flanking, and there's always some side path that'll take you right round the robotic rear. Even if they just follow you, you're squadmates are smart enough to pop em in the back.\nYeah, useful squadmates are a good thing. When you're out of ammo, they'll chuck you some. When you get flanked, they let you know.\nTerminator also tries to build an emotional bond between player and squadmate, and fails completely, I didn't care whether they lived or died, but at least while they're alive, they do stuff. One thing that baffled me though, and it's relentless, no one in the game can stop saying the name John Connor!\nWaaah, get these people some air!\nAnd for a linear game, sometimes it can be hard to find the way, and without a jump button it's annoying being unable to get over a 3 foot piece of concrete. You will spend most of your time behind that concrete though, the machines target you specifically if you're out of cover.\nLike any Star Wars game, it benefits heavily from that memorable franchise music. You could show anything to this music and it would sound epic. I could show you Glados the cat.\nThat is one epic cat, man. I'm actually kinda scared!\nNothing.

It begs the question of whether or not you can equip the vaunted \"connected home\" yet. We're close, but I think there's still some room for improvement, particularly with the various incompatible flavors of DRM out there. That said, there's a plethora of premium content out there for your viewing pleasure, and a growing number of devices to stream it and watch it on.\nThere are two ways to acquire content: record your own or download it. Each has its pluses and minuses, which I hope to discuss more over the next few months. Suffice to say that if you buy your TV commercial-free from the Apple iTunes store (we won't get into illicit downloads for now), you'll need Apple TV. If you record your own, you'll need a Media Center Edition (MCE) PC and an Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender. You can also buy and download content directly to the Xbox, but the selection on Xbox Live Marketplace is fairly sparse at this time.\nAs Windows Vista (Premium and Ultimate versions) has incorporated MCE, many new PCs will let you stream video to an Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender support. All-in-one PCs such as the HP TouchSmart IQ770 provide a wealth of media features, and rigs such as the Velocity Micro CineMagix Grand Theater are specially tailored to home theater.\nBoth the Xbox and the Apple TV sit on your network. They let you watch your TV, home videos, and photos on your TV in your living room. Xbox 360 supports 720p HDTV content, while Apple TV is limited to 480p. Apple TV works with both Windows and Macs. Predictably, Xbox 360 with Media Center Extender support is Windows-only.\nWith Slingbox Pro hooked into your home network, you're not just restricted to streaming content around the house. In fact, you can stream TV content around the world when you travel. You can receive it on a PC that has SlingPlayer software installed or to a Windows Mobile handheld running SlingPlayer Mobile.\nWhether you want your home theater strictly for home or also to go, we have a solution for you. Read on to find one that will keep you entertained.\nSo far one of two shipping MCE systems with CableCARD tuner (the other is the Sony Vaio VGX-XL3), the CineMagix is a powerful home theater-oriented system that can stream premium cable content to an Xbox 360 in your den or family room.\nThis quintessential kitchen PC can stream recorded and live content from its built-in analog cable tuner.

{"prefix": "The first freshman class selected to Florida's state college system since Gov. Jeb Bush put an end to race-based admissions has shown, instead of a decrease in minority enrollment, an increase of 12 percent.\nMr. Bush, whose plan allows the admission of the top 20 percent of graduating seniors from each state high school, whether predominantly black, white or Hispanic, said the increase was proof that diversity in other college systems could be accomplished without affirmative action.\n''The most diverse in history,'' Mr. Bush said of the incoming freshmen, who are the first students to be admitted without affirmative action mandates since racial set-asides were put in place in Florida in 1978.\nHe said his plan, called One Florida, produced an incoming class of more than 40 percent minorities -- blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans -- and could be a model for other states whose affirmative action laws are being challenged in the courts or at the polls.\nBut critics of the plan say it is far too soon, after one year, to call the plan a success. Some experts on education reform called the new system a gimmick that simply gives affirmative action a new name.\nMr. Bush dismissed the criticism as he celebrated what he said was a clear victory in a difficult social and political arena. Black leaders here had said the plan would cripple college admissions of blacks.\n''I've spent the last 10 months getting blistered by people who didn't believe we could do this,'' Mr. Bush said.\nUnlike in Texas and California, which have similar programs that produced initial drops in minority enrollment, ''we did not wait for a legal challenge or a ballot initiative,'' said Mr. Bush.\nTexas courts threw out affirmative action laws in 1996, but the state eventually restored its racial mix on college campuses under a plan in Texas under Gov. George W. Bush that admitted the top 10 percent of students in each school.\nJeb Bush said he used elements of the Texas plan in his own. But it was California's end to affirmative action, in a statewide vote in 1997, that may have forced the Florida governor's hand.\nWard Connerly, a businessman and black conservative who led the battle to end affirmative action in California, had turned his attentions to Florida, and Mr. Bush's One Florida plan was seen as a way to blunt that looming battle in a year that his brother was running for president.\nCritics of the plan, who fought against it when Mr. Bush unveiled it in November, said it is too soon to claim victory, and said the affirmative action program he ended was already steadily improving minority enrollment.\nMr. Bush said the Florida plan does something old affirmative action did not do: It allows students to pursue an education without the stigma of set-asides and lowered admission standards.\n''Every student entering our system today can be proud of what we accomplished, and be confident that achievement, not skin color or ethnic background, is the only measure of merit in our universities,'' he said.\nOf the 3,202 incoming students, 1,234 were minorities, and all 10 colleges in the state system increased their enrollment of blacks, according to statistics from the university system.\nThat increase of black enrollment was not just at predominantly black colleges, but also at Florida's two leading state-run universities -- the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and Florida State University, in Tallahassee.\nThe number of enrolling black students at the University of Florida was up 33 percent from last year, and up 21 percent from last year at Florida State.\nThe number of Hispanic students enrolling at the University of Florida grew by 19 percent, and by 24 percent at Florida State.\nThe two leading universities enrolled 577 more black and Hispanic students this year than last year.\nIn the past, universities had put in place a double standard for minorities, and quotas.\n''Now everybody's in the pool,'' said Carmen Brown", "gen_completion": ", a public policy professor at Florida State who served as dean of the university's public policy school, which has a black graduation rate of 53 percent.\nBoth universities are known to have well-paid jobs for highly educated students for white and Hispanic students.\n''It's not an issue of race or ethnicity any longer,'' Mr. Brown said in an interview. The university system had also recently taken steps to encourage enrollment among minorities.\nAnd at Florida, one of the state's top universities, faculty members in the student affairs office have launched a black mentoring program to recruit highly skilled students to the campus. Among black students joining the program is the daughter of prominent former Vice President Walter Mondale.\nThe program has been so successful so far that it will soon be expanded to provide jobs for white students at Florida state-run public universities.\nExperts of affirmative action say it has become so common on college campuses they can be seen as just an adjunct of admissions policies to entice minority students"}

He did a rough recording and sent it off to Zimbabwe so the band could learn it.\nWhen the group arrived on P.E.I. in August, they rehearsed a bit with Gallant then headed to a friend's studio barn.\n\"In one day we recorded the song and did a video \u2014 the same day,\" said Gallant.\nAward-winning P.E.I. filmmaker John Hopkins shot the video, while Colin Buchanan of The Hill Sound Studio recorded the song.\n\"That's a lot for anybody in one day, and Lennie is known for being \u2014 in the studio he's very meticulous,\" said Jensen.\nGallant used the nativity story of Mary and Joseph's search for a place to stay Christmas Eve as a theme for the song, connecting it to current global immigration crises including the flight from Syria and the migrant caravan from Central America to the U.S.\n\"Given what's going on in the world right now, with so many desperate families driven from their homes, I thought there's really a connection to be made there with the original Christmas story,\" he said.\n\"These are desperate people, desperate families, and it could be you or I cast in the same situation if the geography was a little bit different.\"\nGallant has worked with several charities including Maritime-Guatemala Breaking the Silence, and plans to give any proceeds from the song to the P.E.I.-based charity Mikinduri Children of Hope, which helps care for people in Kenya. Black Umfolosi also works with many charities in Africa, Jensen said.\n\"If Mary and Joseph were showing up at some countries right now, certainly including the United States of America, they would definitely be turned back,\" added Jensen. \"The message is timely and it's delivered in a beautiful way.\"\n\"Reaction to the song and the video has been quite extraordinary so far,\" Gallant said.\n\"And with Black Umfolosi, they were so wonderful to work with \u2014 such gentle, beautiful people and were very much into it and so patient,\" he said.\nGallant predicts the song, available on iTunes and on streaming services, \"will make no money whatsoever probably, because basically on streaming services you're pretty much", "gen_completion": " doing a free download.\"\n\"But for people so passionate about what's happening, particularly in Africa, it might not be that farfetched to think it would make enough to help a bunch of people get by and have the opportunity.\"\nThe song \"does resonate with Canadians, I think, for sure,\" he said. \"I hope it makes people feel something and it does its job.\"\nscombitz@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com/SamanthaLatestz\nALSO IN THE NEWS:\nThe new NHL season may not start as scheduled, but it has plenty of room for a return to form\nHundreds expected to protest U.S. border patrol chief at Saskatoon mosque\nProudest moment, greatest regret of 2018\nFederal NDP calls for investigation after MPs allege 'appalling' treatment at Winnipeg school facility\nLetters to the editor should include your full name, address and phone number.

What better place to share this collection than here in the African village that is Brooklyn and what better time than the 50th anniversary of Restoration\"\nThe exhibit will present pieces as diverse as a woman's head carved out of stone dating back 4,000 years to the Nok Dynasty (Niger) to a carved wooden royal coffin to Ebo Ceremonial Dance Dress. The exhibit highlights African art as integral to African life. The universal ethos of African art positions art as a fundamental part of culture: from tools to utensils to dress to musical instruments; art is never created for art's sake.

Seashore Professor of Research in Music Education.\nDuring the 1970s, Gordon spent a critical portion of his career at UB, researching and defining music learning theory, and coining the term \"audiation\" -- the cognitive process by which the brain comprehends music -- along the way.\nHe went on to become an internationally recognized scholar, featured often in the media, from NBC's \"Today Show\" to The New York Times. He is author of six highly regarded music aptitude tests, as well as numerous books on the psychology of music, music rhythm, music learning theory, tonal and rhythm patterns, and music development in infants and very young children. He taught at Temple University until 1997.\nBut Gordon has not forgotten the place where his acclaimed research in music learning theory began, and he has returned to UB several times, as a distinguished visiting scholar in music education in the Department of Learning and Instruction. Although he is in his early 80s, Gordon has taught a week-long workshop on music learning theory at UB the past several summers.\nAt the July 30 reception, Gordon's family, many of his former students, UB music education alumni and area music dignitaries will be on hand to pay tribute to his lifetime of major contributions in his field.\nThe UB Foundation and GIA Publications, Inc., which published Gordon's first edition of Learning Sequences and Patterns in Music in 1976, are co-sponsors of the event.

{"prefix": "It\u2019s 2024: Guess What\u2019s Not in Your Wallet?\nLast year, one in three victims who had their financial accounts hacked experienced identify fraud, according to a recent study from the National Consumer League.\nData breaches have become so prevalent that they&apos;ve grown to be part of the public consciousness, and they haven&apos;t shifted our purchasing methods: Americans continue to whip out plastic 66% of the time we make a purchase.\nThe convenience and habit of credit cards outweigh the potential risk of having your identity stolen or bank account sucked dry. In addition, Javelin senior analyst Nick Holland points out that \u201cconsumers have a short memory, [and are also] well-protected by their credit card companies\u201d in terms of limiting their liability for unauthorized purchases.\nHolland explains that even though we reacted with \"shock and horror\" following the massive Target (NYSE:TGT) data breach at the end of 2013, there is an upside: The incident forced the public and the government to finally address the vulnerabilities of our current system.\nHaving to sign a receipt for a purchase will eventually go the way of transistor radios and flip phones. You know those electronic signature pads at many checkouts? In Holland\u2019s words, signing one is \u201clike a drunk writing on an Etch-a-Sketch.\u201d Not only does it not remotely resemble your actual handwriting, it\u2019s barely legible. (When is the last time the clerk even bothered to compare it to the signature on the back of your credit card?) Using your fingerprint would be a lot safer. The folks at Apple have already anticipated this and have added a fingerprint scanner to new iPhones. Your voice might also be used to authenticate your purchase down the road.\nFive years from now, the study forecasts all types of electronic payments to increase as cash purchases fall to 17% and checks to 5%.\nFrom the consumer\u2019s perspective, consider the everyday example of putting gas in your car. If you\u2019re paying by cash, you fill your tank, walk into the store, stand in line to pay and wait for the cashier to make change. Compare this to driving up to the pump, swiping your credit card and immediately driving away after you fill up.\nThere\u2019s also the \u201cup-spend\u201d factor: If you\u2019re using plastic, your spending is not limited by the amount of cash in your wallet.\nHolland adds that electronic transactions are \u201can international leveler.\u201d If you have a credit card, travel outside the U.S. no longer requires you to bring a wad of foreign currency or travelers checks. Likewise, foreign visitors to this country can swipe their American Express card and pay it off in their country&apos", "gen_completion": ";s currency in seconds using the magnetic stripe reader. The whole process is significantly quicker, smoother and cheaper than using cash or checks.\nIn addition to creating faster and cheaper payments, electronic payment systems require fewer humans to administer and maintain. The American Express and MasterCard network have grown from four to 35 branches in five years &apos; and the Visa network now has over 1,200 locations.\nIn this way, electronic payment systems, instead of slowing adoption of plastic cards, are accelerating it. The convenience of digital payment systems should help encourage us to shop less and spend the extra money we do save instead on other products that offer economic benefit for society as a whole.\nPhoto by Stephen M.

Tim cracked up when I asked Albert if he still had the bicycle. I knew it was gauche of me, but I couldn't resist. A short time later Albert pulled over.\"\nHere is an excerpt of the conversation between Albert and Tim, after they picked us up at the train station.

He also became interested in life extension and space migration, which he discussed in an exchange of letters with astronomer Carl Sagan.\nA previously unknown connection between Czech dissident Vaclav Havel and American psychologist Timothy Leary is revealed by an inscribed copy of Leary's 1977 Neuropolitics.\nMichael Horowitz*, Timothy Leary's longtime archivist, has permitted the Timothy Leary Archives website to publish a transcription of a tape recorded conversation between Dr. Leary and his wife Rosemary, and John Lennon and Yoko Ono, made during John and Yoko's Bed-In for Peace in Montreal, May 1969.

{"prefix": "1947: Capt. Charles E. \u201cChuck\u201d Yeager pilots the rocket-powered Bell X-1 to a speed of Mach 1.07, becoming the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound. In breaking the sound barrier, Yeager becomes the fastest man alive \u2014 and the legend of the X-Planes begins.\nAs airplanes flew faster and faster throughout the 1930s, pilots began to experience a number of problems associated with the increased airspeed. Aircraft such as the Lockheed P-38 and Republic P-47 flew just fine at ordinary speeds in level flight. But if pilots put them in a high-speed dive, they began to experience control problems that led to the deaths of several pilots.\nThe main problem facing these pilots was the aerodynamic condition known as compressibility. Simply stated, at speeds well below the speed of sound, most of the air molecules have time to get out of the way of an aircraft as it approaches, and the density of the air does not change.\nHowever, as the speed of sound is approached, the air molecules can\u2019t get out of the way, and more of them hit the aircraft. The impact compresses the air in front of the aircraft and increases the air density. Eventually shock waves form around the airplane, affecting the lift and drag. These changes were not well-understood and led to the loss of control in several aircraft.\nBecause the effects of compressibility are directly related to the speed of sound, a ratio is used to describe the speed of an aircraft. The Mach number is the speed at which an object is traveling relative to the speed of sound at a particular temperature. The name is in honor of physicist Ernest Mach, who studied high-speed gas dynamics.\nThe Bell X-1 was developed to research aerodynamics in the transonic region, or speeds just below and just above the speed of sound. After numerous flights with civilian test pilots, Capt. Yeager of the newly formed U.S. Air Force made his first powered flight in the X-1 on Aug. 29, 1947, high over the Mojave Desert of southern California.\nThe problem Yeager was experiencing was the ineffectiveness of the X-1\u2019s pitch controls, as shock waves essentially created an aerodynamic shadow around the tail. Changes were made to the horizontal tail controls, allowing Yeager to control the airplane's ability to pitch up and down, and flights continued. This knowledge would lead to the all-flying tail, or stabilator, standard on all supersonic fighters today.\nYeager was nursing two broken ribs on the morning of Oct. 14, after being thrown from his horse on a ride the night before. He boarded the B-29 bomber that was to carry the Bell X-1 to altitude. The plan was to fly to Mach 0.97. But Yeager says the new moving tail boosted his morale, and he wanted to fly faster.\nAfter climbing down into the X-1, which was carried like a bomb in the belly of the B-29, Yeager\u2019s friend and fellow test pilot Jack Ridley handed him a short, sawed-off section of broomstick. Yeager would use it to close the canopy of the X-1, because his broken ribs prevented him from closing the latch normally.\nPeople on the ground heard what sounded like distant thunder. It was the first sonic boom ever created by an aircraft. At age 24, Yeager had flown faster than the speed of sound.\nThe flight was kept secret, and the world wouldn\u2019t know about the first supersonic", "gen_completion": " flight, which would push the boundaries of flight and space exploration for years.

The driver, and a person suspected of shooting the driver, were both killed, the police said. The 29 others were injured.\nThe two-section bus was just starting to cross Aurora Avenue Bridge, which spans the Lake Union ship canal, about 3:10 P.M. when the driver was shot by a passenger, the police said. The bus, heading south, jumped a lane of northbound traffic, hit a van, then crashed through a guardrail and fell 50 feet, landing upright in an apartment garden in the Fremont district, an area of residential buildings, restaurants and businesses.\nPolice officers did not disclose a motive for the shooting. They said that two people were involved, and that the second person was among the injured taken to the hospital. The gun was recovered at the hospital, the police said.\nWitnesses described a scene of panic as people with broken bones and bleeding cuts tried to crawl out of the bus. Rescue officials pulled out several people who were stuck in the bus.\nMr. Badgley said he had seen two injured people on the roof of the apartments. When aid units arrived, they gave emergency treatment to people who could be seen on the apartment roof.\nAll the passengers were injured, fire department officials said. Fifteen of the injured were in critical condition tonight and 10 were listed in serious condition, said a Fire Department spokeswoman, Sheila Strehle.\nThe driver, whose name was not released by the police, was thrown from the bus, fire officials said.\nThe bus is a two-compartment vehicle with the two units held together by an accordion-like mechanism. It usually carries 120 passengers. Had the bus traveled another quarter-mile or so, it would have fallen several hundred feet and landed in the water. But because the crash happened at the low end of the bridge, the bus landed on ground.\nDan Williams, a spokesman for Metro Bus who arrived at the scene within minutes of the crash, said the bus was not smoking when it landed. Fire Department officials said there no fire on board. But they expressed amazement that the bus had landed upright.\n''Nothing like this has ever happened, that I know of,'' Mr. Williams said.

Others rushed out of the bus to help others. A woman jumped off of the bridge to run toward a helicopter landing at the airport. She appeared to be in her 30s. She had dark hair, a small face hole in her upper lip, and a black surgical garment wrapped around her waist. A police officer pulled her back on shore.\nWitnesses said they had been startled when the bus suddenly accelerated and began to speed away, crashing into a van headed northbound on Aurora Avenue.

{"prefix": "Swiss power gear company ABB (s abb) has made another investment in tech that can make data centers more energy-efficient. Thursday morning, ABB says it has acquired controlling interest \u2014 through its venture arm (ABB Technology Ventures) \u2014 in Validus DC Systems, an 11-year-old company that makes power systems for data centers that utilize direct current (DC), which can make data centers more energy-efficient.\nI\u2019m hearing the deal is a large \u2014 eight-figure \u2014 buyout of existing shareholders, which included Oak Hill Ventures and Validus management, and a new $8 million Series B investment. The investment could also essentially be a two-step M&A, where ABB would have first dibs to buy the company outright at a later date. Validus previously raised at least $10 million from Oak Hill Ventures.\nValidus DC Systems sells data center power supply systems, along with converters and data center gear, based on DC tech. DC technology is more energy-efficient than AC (there is less energy lost in the transmission) and is also less complex and the gear can be built into smaller spaces. Validus says its DC technology can cut down on the total cost of a data center \u2014 via both energy savings and space savings \u2014 by 30 percent.\nIn addition to energy efficiency, use of DC technology can make a data center more reliable because there are fewer times in the system when the power has to be converted from AC to DC. DC can also pull in solar and wind power directly, though few data center operators are yet utilizing all that much clean power.\nABB already sells data center power gear like power distribution and management systems, emergency back-up power tech, circuit breakers, surge protectors, motors and building control and automation systems. ABB also provides high-voltage DC lines for long distance power transmission and has supplied one of the longest HVDC lines in the world. Adding Validus\u2019 DC products into ABB\u2019s mix is a natural fit.\nABB has also been focused on energy efficiency of data centers in particular. In September, ABB announced it had invested into Valley startup Power Assure, which makes", "gen_completion": " solar panels for edge data centers in under-banked third-world countries. A separate ABB subsidiary also recently licensed its technology, which can help address grid challenges in Europe, to Vestas.\n\u201cWe see tremendous opportunity for efficiency in the data center \u2013 which accounts for some of the most energy-intensive operations \u2013 using clean, renewable energy,\u201d said Arjen van Dijk, chief operating officer of Validus, in a press statement. \u201cWe hope to contribute to the shift to a more energy-efficient data center network.\u201d\nABB\u2019s latest investment follows other investments into the renewable energy space.

{"prefix": "Recent reforms were hailed as progress, but advocates say the system is still riddled with problems.\nRecent federal reforms aimed at protecting prisoners from exorbitant phone bills still fall short of reining in prices on the the vast majority of inmate calls, federal officials and prisoners' advocates said Wednesday.\nThe new rules, enacted in February by the Federal Communications Commission, cap prices for out-of-state calls. But most calls from prisoners are in-state communications, which remain unregulated.\nAdvocates say call fees have long been a problem for inmates and their families. Costly charges can leave prisoners with thousands of dollars in phone bills when they get out. In some cases, people have been forced to choose between phone calls and food. And children who lack regular contact with their incarcerated parents are more likely to miss school, become homeless, or suffer depression.\nThe FCC, led by interim Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn, took a step toward addressing that problem last year. The agency's ruling capped prices for interstate phone calls at 21 cents per minute for prepaid calls and 25 cents per minute for collect calls. Previous prices had exceeded $1 a minute in some cases.\nWhen the FCC put forth its original ruling in 2013, it expressed a desire to address in-state rates as well, seeking comment on possible proposals to do so. But the telephone companies that challenged the out-of-state caps have threatened opposition to in-state rules as well, and any FCC attempt to reform them would likely trigger a legal battle over the FCC's jurisdiction.\nBut with in-state calls still unregulated, some prisoners are paying much more for their local calls. In New Jersey, for instance, some in-state calls can run more than $8 for 15 minutes on the phone.\n\"The reforms thus far, though significant, have had very little impact because the majority of inmate calling is intrastate,\" said Darrell Baker, an Alabama utility official who has led that state's push to lower its call rates.\n\"The FCC's decision did a lot, but it certainly didn't help for large numbers of people,\" said Cheryl Leanza, an advocate with the United Church of Christ.\nFCC leaders, including Clyburn, Wheeler, and Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, said last year's reforms are a starting point, but agreed that in-state calls still need to be addressed.\n\"We recognize that more needs to be done,\" FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in his opening remarks at a Wednesday panel at the agency's Washington headquarters.\nThe FCC, however, is asking states to take the lead on intrastate calling. Some states \u2014 including Alabama \u2014 have taken steps to protect prisoners from predatory rates.\nSimilar to the FCC's out-of-state rules, Alabama moved recently to cap in-state call fees at 25 cents per minute.\nBut with most states still inactive on the issue, some are calling for federal intervention.\n\"The FCC has both the duty and the authority to act under the statute if states do not,\" Clyburn said.\nOthers think the FCC's role should be limited advising state officials.\n\"Much of the heavy lifting is now left to the states,\" said Jesse Wiese, who works with the faith-based criminal-justice reform group Justice Fellowship. \"We don't think the commission should regulate intrastate calls.\" Wiese said the agency should focus on working with lawmakers and regulators around the country to enact reforms.\nBut inmate calling problems aren't limited to high intrastate prices.

{"prefix": "It\u2019s not that the human immune system doesn\u2019t recognize HIV. Indeed, an infection causes the body to unleash antibodies that attack the virus, and initially some HIV is destroyed.\nBut HIV is able to quickly defend itself by co-opting a part of the innate human immune system \u2014 the immune system people are born with, called the complement. The complement includes a vital mechanism that prevents immune system cells from attacking the body\u2019s own cells. HIV is able to incorporate a key protein in that self-protection mechanism, CD59, and by doing so makes itself appear to be one of the body\u2019s normal cells, not an infective agent.\nIn laboratories at the Indiana University School of Medicine, Andy Qigui Yu, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of microbiology and immunology, is testing a promising compound that may counteract HIV\u2019s ability to hijack the immune system\u2019s protection mechanism.\n\u201cHIV is very clever. As it replicates inside cells, it takes on the CD59. The virus is covered with CD59, so the immune system treats the virus like your own normal cells,\u201d Dr. Yu said.\nIn November, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced it had awarded nine new Grand Challenges Explorations Phase II grants, one of them to Dr. Yu. The Phase II grants were awarded to researchers who had received initial $100,000 awards and had shown promising results.\nThe new grant will support not only Dr. Yu\u2019s research into compounds that may block the ability of HIV to hide behind the CD59 \u201ccloak,\u201d but also his work to identify the mechanism the virus uses to incorporate CD59.\n\u201cIf we find that mechanism, then we can develop something to block that incorporation, and HIV may lose that protection from the immune system,\u201d Dr. Yu said.\nResearchers have been able in the past to generate antibodies that successfully attacked HIV in the laboratory. But these antibodies have failed in human testing because the virus in the body escapes from immune system attacks, Dr. Yu said.\nIn an attempt to disrupt HIV\u2019s hijacking of CD59, Yu and colleagues at IU and Harvard University crafted a molecule from a bacterial toxin that is known to bind to the CD59 protein.

{"prefix": "Now, a new study offers insight into why some people shrug off physical touches and how families affected by autism may learn to share hugs without overwhelming an autistic child\u2019s senses.\nYale neuroscientists recruited 19 young adults and imaged their brain activity as a researcher lightly brushed them on the forearm with a soft watercolor paintbrush. In some cases, the brushing was quick, and in others slow: prior studies have shown that most people like slow brushing and perceive it as affectionate contact, while the faster version is felt as less pleasant and more tickle-like.\nNone of the participants in the current study had autism, but the researchers evaluated them for autistic traits \u2014 things like a preference for sameness, order and systems, rather than social interaction. They found that participants with the highest levels of autistic traits had a lower response in key social brain regions \u2014 the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) \u2014 to the slow brushing.\nAccording to Martha Kaiser, senior author of the study and associate director of the Child Neuroscience Laboratory at the Yale Child Study Center, the STS is a critical hub of the social brain. \u201cThis region is important for perceiving the people around us, for visual social stimuli and for perceiving social versus nonsocial sounds,\u201d she says.\nThe current findings suggest that the region is also involved in processing social touch and that its response is linked to the individual\u2019s social ability, she says.\nIf that\u2019s the case, finding ways to make social experience \u2014 including touch \u2014 more rewarding might be one way to help autistic people connect better with others.\nIndeed, Temple Grandin, the well-known author and animal scientist with autism, and the subject of a 2010 HBO biopic, famously built herself a", "gen_completion": " hug-machine.

That could help to explain why some people on the Autismspectrum feel touch feels less pleasure than others. \u201cIf you could learn how to detect these pain signals and adapt based on any changes in response,\u201d she says, \u201cthen perhaps, instead of changing for each person, people on the spectrum could use a single pattern rather than constantly change what they respond to."}

{"prefix": "My best friend in college was a straight-A student, an English major. In part he got all A\u2019s because he is whip smart\u2014his essays were systematically better than everyone else\u2019s. But the other reason was that he refused to enroll in a course unless he was certain he would ace it. Consequently, he never really challenged himself to try something beyond his comfort zone. I, on the other hand, was not a straight-A student. My first semester I took atomic physics with Professor Delroy Baugh, self-proclaimed \u201cLaser Guy.\u201d I\u2019d never taken a physics course before in my life, and as a reward for my willingness to transcend my comfort zone I received a D.\nSomewhere between the two of us lies a sweet spot: if you only ever get 100 percent on your tests, they aren\u2019t hard enough. If you never get above 50 percent, you\u2019re probably in the wrong major. The trick is to be right enough, but not so right that you never allow yourself the opportunity to be wrong.\nSo, how wrong should you be?\nWilson and his colleagues derive the number from experiments in machine learning. Under loose assumptions, they show that the optimal error rate for training a broad class of deep learning algorithms is 15 percent. The fastest learning progress occurs when the error rate hits this sweet spot. They show that this number is also in line with previous work on learning in humans and animals.\nThe implications of the 85 percent rule in the classroom are straightforward. If you\u2019re a teacher, your tests should be difficult enough that the average score is 85 percent. If you\u2019re a student, the optimal level of challenge is about a B or a B+ average. An A might look nice on your transcript, but you could have stood to learn more from a class that was harder. Outside the classroom, the implications of the 85 percent rule are similar. If you are learning a new language, say on Duolingo, then you should be getting about 15 percent of the answers wrong. Otherwise, you\u2019re not being challenged at the right level to consistently improve in picking up your new language.\nBut the 85 percent rule only holds for one class of problems, where the point is to build up expertise over many trials. With other kinds of problems you really don\u2019t want to get them wrong at all. For example, should you believe in God? Pascal wagered that you should, because if you don\u2019t there\u2019ll be hell to pay. Most people make up their minds one way about this issue and tend not to change their position too frequently. This presents a paradox: suppose 50 percent of people believe in God and 50 percent don\u2019t. Half are on the side opposite the truth. Yet no matter what evidence you present them with they won\u2019t admit they\u2019re wrong. In this case we see an error rate of zero. Why is no one ever wrong about their belief in God?\nHere another answer comes from cognitive science, in a paper by Samuel Gershman of Harvard University titled \u201cHow to Never Be Wrong.\u201d In the paper Gershman considers the problem of auxiliary hypotheses. The idea is that any given theory comes with a set of undisclosed assumptions, which can protect the core theory from being disproved. For example, the seven-day creation story of Genesis is at odds with the fossil record. So if you accept the fossil record, do you have to forfeit Genesis?\nNope. All you have to do is note that a \u201cday\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be 24 hours\u2014especially not if God hasn\u2019t created", "gen_completion": " a 365-day day in his plan. If so, you would have to conclude that there isn\u2019t a day seven days in a row. You would have to conclude, as Gershman does, that a day is just a variable that can vary, that is it has no fixed period. If this happens you would also have to conclude that God may have been wrong about the existence of the seven-day creation story. But this would raise a question. Gershman, at least, thinks God did a good job of explaining his reasoning: \u201cThe hypothesis of the long day, which I propose as evidence that the universe was created by a creative God, or at least created in the long day, seems logically more tractable than that the universe has a natural duration.\u201d\nEven if that theory were true, the paradox of the 85 percent rule still remains. It could be that God did take 12 days for his creation from what was immediately around it"}

More importantly, the budget is said to have risen above a \"lowered\" $215 million - and ballooned back up to the $250 million level that prompted Disney to halt the project's development in the first place.\nWith respect to principal photography being behind schedule: that's actually less of a concern, seeing how Disney recently pushed Lone Ranger's release date back from May 2013 to the fourth of July weekend slot previously occupied by Robopocalypse. Right now, newly-appointed Disney studio head Alan Horn is thought to be focused on trimming the film's budget (via script rewrites of certain expensive action scenes). Obviously, the Mouse House is all the more concerned about expenditures, after having to take an estimated $200 million loss on John Carter - which \"helped\" to force out Horn's predecessor, Rich Ross.\nObviously, the primary concern for moviegoers is whether or not Lone Ranger will ultimately prove to be worth all the behind-the-scenes financial drama.

One of the men, James H. Serene, combined his last name and \u201cAlbemarle,\u201d coining the name of the community that became home for the workers of one of the area\u2019s largest employers. Several of the homes built then are still there, along with a mix of ranch-style houses from the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.\nAHIP knew from its extensive waitlist data that there was high demand for rehab and energy-efficiency work in southern Albemarle. The two-year CDBG funding will allow AHIP and the county to carry out comprehensive rehab projects and tackle failing roofs, lack of heat, failed wells and septic systems, faulty plumbing, dangerous electrical systems, unsafe structures, peeling paint, dilapidated kitchens and bathrooms, mold, hazardous steps, lack of insulation, broken windows and doors, and more.\nAdditionally, all appliances replaced and weatherization upgrades will meet national EnergyStar standards. Client families being served through the Alberene Improvement Project are expected to have lower utility costs, as well as consume 10-20 percent less energy.\nWork will soon be underway on projects for the first of 18 families that will receive help in Phase 1; 11 more are slated for Phase 2. The joint effort will help extremely low- to low-income families, with the 72 people included in the two-year plan earning 38 percent of Area Median Income.\n\u201cI have an old house, I love the old house. But, it\u2019s hard to keep all that up and when a house gets to be a certain age, it just needs more work,\u201d said Alberene homeowner Nancy Wray in an interview with NBC29 earlier this year. Wray\u2019s home was built in 1903, and she has lived there for 31 years. She works part time for a local nonprofit. AHIP helped Wray in December 2014 by installing a new HVAC system after a house fire left her without heat. Her home needs extensive repairs and upgrades to be safe and fully functional.\n\u201cI have some leaky roof issues. I have a bad floor in my kitchen which makes me very nervous,\u201d said Wray.\nSince 1982, the federally funded CDBG program has been administered by the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development. During this year", "gen_completion": "\u2019s cycle, nearly 6,500 local projects across Virginia will receive funding.\n\u201cCommunity Development Block Grants continue to play an important role in the state\u2019s home improvement programs, offering important funding for projects like these and making sure communities across Virginia can get what they need to improve their homes for affordable housing,\u201d said Secretary of Community Development Brian Moran. \u201cBy working together in Albemarle, AHIP and the County are able to help dozens of neighbors in Albemarle get and keep the home they deserve.\u201d\nFind out more at www.virginia.gov/dcd/obstacle.asp\nFor More Information:\nAHIP\nAlberene Community Coalition\nCounty of Albemarle\nProject Hope for Homeowners\nAlberene Improvement Project\nProject Hope Center\nNational Low-Income Housing Coalition\nProject Hope Center\nPhoto by Brian Hodge, Albemarle-Al"}

But unlike at other conferences, where the flashing lights and neon colors that educators have come to expect emanate brightly from the stage, the mood was somber\u2014with keynote speaker Paul Saffo asking serious questions about the future of education and the role technology will play.\nAs attendees and exhibitors sat in their seats, sipping Seattle\u2019s trademark beverage, their eyes focused on the stage: Seattle\u2019s black skyline with hues of purple and blue, clouds massed on the horizon\u2014signaling rain clouds on the way.\nAccording to Saffo, there are some tips educators can use to predict the next big technological innovation that will directly affect the economy.\nFirst, take a look at history: In the 1950s, the key technological innovation was the television\u2014and the media expression of it was broadcasting in the 1960s. In the 1980s, it was the client server that led to the media expression of the World Wide Web of the 1990s. Earlier this decade, peer-to-peer file sharing and online social networks emerged, and perhaps in the next decade, sites like Twitter will be the definitive media expression.\n\u201cIf you look at these trends, technology makes the medium possible, but the \u2026 medium is not ubiquitous until the next big innovation comes along,\u201d explained Saffo. There is a trend of a decade\u2019s difference between the technology and the medium\u2014and most media will not be fully integrated until the next new technology is able to leverage the decade-old medium.\nSaffo listed examples, such as an avatar site called Habitat in the 1980s. Even though it was the same concept as we see today in sites such as Second Life\u2014the avatar moved around a virtual world, buying things and being able to talk to people\u2014the right platform just wasn\u2019t there, and it failed.\nAccording to Saffo, it wasn\u2019t until gaming became popular and gaming software improved that people got into virtual worlds. Thanks to new gaming technology, Second Life is now a huge success.\nAnother example", "gen_completion": " Saffo gave is the game in which a character walks around a whiteboard in a circle (or a circle inside a circle). Originally this involved a whiteboard, plus a video camera\u2014which was expensive to manufacture. Saffo said that it is likely that the next new technology will be the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain. This is where an entire person can move around a virtual space within a computer\u2019s memory.\nSo, the next big innovation will have something to do with the brain\u2014and that means how that person moves\u2014or where they move\u2014or where their head is\u2014will now be part of the computing environment that has everything a human can do via technology available now.\n\u201cThe brain will become the computing unit of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain,\u201d said Saffo.

Of course, in reality, that\u2019s only part of the definition. Any unexplained, welcome situation necessarily needs the person or people involved in the event itself to decide that it\u2019s a miracle.\nThis poses a problem for the cinematic retelling of a story that its author is convinced is miraculous. In fact, it\u2019s a problem facing almost all recent faith-based films; faith is an unseen force, and film must give audiences something to see. \u201cMiracles From Heaven,\u201d then, qualifies as a success: It delivers its miracle without strain.\nBased on the memoir by Beam, \u201cMiracles\u201d tells the story of young Anna Beam (Kylie Rogers, \u201cSpace Station 76\u201d), whose unexplained digestive disorder leads Christy to battle with a variety of doctors and misdiagnoses. Confidently told that the situation is merely lactose intolerance, or acid reflux, Christy remains unconvinced. Anna vomits everything she eats and is in near-constant pain.\nDesperate for an answer, the mother and daughter travel from Texas to Boston, with Christy begging her way into seeing Dr. Samuel Nurko (Eugenio Derbez, \u201cJack and Jill\u201d), a leading pediatric gastroenterologist. Once there, Anna is diagnosed with intestinal motility disorder, a paralysis of the G.I. tract, a degenerative condition with no cure.\nDriven away from church by fellow members who blame sin for the child\u2019s illness, Christy\u2019s doubts overwhelm her. \u201cI don\u2019t have faith in anything. I can\u2019t even pray,\u201d she tells husband Kevin (Martin Henderson, \u201cThe Ring\u201d). Anna, too, succumbs to hopelessness, in one of the more honest depictions of childhood depression in recent mainstream film. A good-hearted pastor (John Carroll Lynch, \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d) and waitress (Queen Latifah) intervene, but nothing can solve the medical or spiritual crisis.\nThen comes the miracle of the title, and it either happened that way or it did not.

{"prefix": "1 What Are the Aims & Objectives of HR Development?\nOne of the key roles of the human resources department is to keep the workforce safe, productive and engaged in the company\u2019s activities and interests. HR training objectives support this role by educating employees and managers on the relevant procedures. Training objectives focus on what the organization needs to achieve and how to help employees attain company goals. Depending on the type of business and specific challenges the company faces, there are a wide range of possible HR training objectives. However, some are important in almost every organization.\nEvery employer has a duty to provide a safe and healthy working environment. Every employee has a duty to protect himself and those around him. Health and safety is an area that is often included as part of the HR function in small and medium-sized companies. In large organizations, there may be a dedicated health and safety department. Managers need to be trained in risk assessments and the importance of undertaking them regularly and correctly, while implementing any necessary actions quickly. Neglecting this duty can lead to injury, illness, death and legal action against the company. All of these have significant financial costs that may put the company\u2019s future at risk. As all staff must be made aware of health and safety issues and company policies, this is a significant ongoing training objective for every company.\nCompanies avoid unlawful behaviors and potential lawsuits by ensuring all staff are aware of the basic legal requirements regarding equalities and have an understanding of the benefits of diversity. Equality training equips managers to work within the legal structure and avoid discrimination in recruitment and how they treat staff. A diverse workforce brings many advantages to a company including a range of skills and ideas. However, it is important that everyone is able to communicate effectively with a desire to work together. HR training in diversity can help staff make the most of their working relationships and develop new insights into how the business interacts with its customers and the wider community.\nBeing able to manage staff effectively is essential for every manager. This includes how to run recruitment campaigns and choose the right people; supervise them and maximize their performance; maintain good employee relations; and build teams. While complex issues can be handed over to an HR manager, day-to-day staff management is the responsibility of line", "gen_completion": " managers and the recruitment directors. Many different disciplines and functions need to be run and supervised effectively and efficiently to create an excellent business, and the role of the HR department and training and development is integral to all of these processes.\nCreating a better understanding of the role of the employee is also an important HR training objective. Employees themselves need to understand everything they do and why they are doing it. This is in order to help them make the correct decisions in order to create an effective working and learning environment. A lack of knowledge in this area leads to legal problems and can put the business in an uncomfortable position, which can increase the employee turnover rate. By providing employees with all necessary resources to make decisions about their employment, managers can focus on business issues rather than any specific HR training objectives.\nUnderstanding the workplace is always changing. Organisations have to manage the risks and responsibilities of the growing number of employee groups and their impact on internal and external processes.

Still, he said he believes Moscow has the ability to cause major disruptions using cyber operations.\n\"I know they have the ability to do at least as much damage as they did in Estonia and Georgia,\" he said.\nEstonia suffered a 10-day attack on its internet services in 2007, which caused major disruptions to its financial system, during a spat with Moscow over a Soviet-era war memorial, and Georgia was hit by mass cyber attacks during a brief 2008 war with Russia over its pro-Moscow South Ossetia region.\nRussian authorities denied direct involvement in both attacks, saying they had no influence over the actions of self-styled patriotic hackers.\nMuch of Ukraine's telecommunications infrastructure was built when it was part of the Soviet Union, along with what is now the Russian Federation, and is particularly vulnerable to penetration by Moscow.\n\"The Russians have the place completely wired,\" said Jim Lewis, a former U.S. foreign service officer and now senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\"They are right next door and most traffic has to go through Russia. That they haven't done more probably reflects their confidence that they're going to come out ahead and there's nothing anyone can do about it,\" Lewis said.\nCyber warfare experts say that while Russia certainly has the ability to conduct such campaigns against Ukraine, it has yet to need to use those capabilities.\n\"This would show the Russians acting with more discretion and targeting than recently,\" said John Bassett", "gen_completion": ", director of the Digital Forensic Research Lab.

In 2012, two young campers drowned after wading into the Merced River in Yosemite National Park. According to a Wonkblog analysis of National Park Service data, drowning is the leading cause of death in National Parks.\nEmergency rescuers responded not once, not twice, but three times to satellite tracker calls of one group of Grand Canyon backpackers in 2009 despite there being no real emergency. The first time, the hikers feared they ran out of water. Upon finding a water source they called again fearing the water tasted too salty. Finally, after calling a third time, a helicopter lifted them out of the canyon.\nWeather is often unpredictable in wild areas\u2014if storms are remotely in the forecast, don\u2019t risk it. When one group of canyoneers in Utah\u2019s Zion National Park left to belay down Keyhole Canyon, weather reports noted a moderate chance for flash flooding, but by the time that warning went up to probable, the group was out of cell phone range. The group was later found dead after drowning in the canyon.\nWe\u2019ve all gotten the memo from Smokey the Bear, but some people just don\u2019t listen.

{"prefix": "Breweries find spaces \u2014 and a welcome \u2014 in D.C.\nAs brew lovers celebrated the growing popularity of craft beer during last week\u2019s fifth annual D.C. Beer Week, real estate observers are marveling over the market changes that have seen the return of the first production breweries to the District since the Christian Heurich Brewing Co. shut down its Foggy Bottom brewing operations in 1956.\nBack when D.C. Beer Week first started in 2008, there were no production breweries in the District proper. Now there are three, and two more breweries are planning to open. The growing popularity of craft beer in the region dates back to 1992 when Capitol City Brewing Co. became the first \u201cbrewpub\u201d to open in the city since Prohibition. Since then, numerous brewpubs have opened throughout the region. The chief distinction between these establishments and breweries is that brewpubs primarily brew beer for sale on site in their restaurant and bar locations, and as such they generally occupy retail/restaurant spaces.\nProduction breweries, on the other hand, primarily produce beer sold off-site in local bars, restaurants and other outlets. As production facilities, they generally occupy industrial-quality space, with high ceilings and reinforced flooring to accommodate the brewing, bottling and distribution equipment.\nThese days, the trend appears to be favoring more of a hybrid approach with the newest breweries serving their wares on site as well as having the production capacity for distribution.\nDC Brau Brewing Co. became the first production brewery inside the District lines since the Heurichs closed up shop. Originally operating in a modest 6,600-square-foot space at 3178 Bladensburg Rd. NE, the operation has since doubled in size (as of 2012) and currently operates out of 13,150 square feet.\nNext to follow suit was Chocolate City Beer, opening at 2801 8th S.t NE in 2011. Working out of a two-story brick industrial building, this operation now serves its brews at more than 40 different local restaurants.\nThe most recently opened D.C. brewery is 3 Stars Brewing Co., which leased more than 15,000 square feet to open the largest of the D.C. breweries, at 6400 Chillum Pl. NW. This property has 22-foot-high ceilings, which provide ample room for the brewing equipment.\nOn the horizon, there are at least two more players hoping to quench the thirst of D.C. beer aficionados", "gen_completion": ". The first is the debut of the St. Tammany Brewing Co., planned for 4500 H.P. Robinson St. NW, which will come in above a planned brewpub called Urban Brewery Brewing Co. The second is Big Rock Brewery Co., slated to open next spring at 2852 G. Gage Blvd. NW. The size and design of the facility are not yet specified, but it is likely to include an upstairs brewpub to allow for more seating.\nLast year\u2019s top two D.C.BeerWEEK winners, Double Dutch and D.C. Hop-Avenue, expanded their brands in the city. With both brands having expanded their operations significantly over the past several years, expect to see many more of these growth projects taking shape as well.\nLike WTOP on Facebook and follow @WTOP on Twitter to engage in conversation about this article and others.\n\u00a9 2018 WTOP.

The code also requires two separate lockers in either wing of a single unit for people who share it.\nCritics question whether lockers would actually help those in need. The city would likely have to fund the facility on top of the current housing authority reimbursement. The city would have to create new programs in addition to paying for it.

Delhi has a sizable voter population that belongs to the two states.\nThe AAP leader said attacking Modi directly during the MCD polls campaign may backfire.\nIn the recent Assembly election in Punjab, AAP could win 20 of 117 seats, while drew a blank in 40-member Goa Assembly.\nDuring the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, AAP's strategy revolved around attacking Modi.

They can't even remain true to their Prime Minister,\" Kejriwal said.\nHe also referred to the CBI raid on office of his former principal secretary Rajendra Kumar in the Delhi Secretariat and case registered against PWD Minister Satyendar Jain. Again there was no reference to Modi.\nAfter the raid on Kumar's office in December 2015, Kejriwal had invited criticism for accusing the PM of staging the raid and calling him a \"coward\" and a \"psychopath\".\nA sample analysis of Kejriwal tweets, who has over 11 million followers second only to Modi, post Punjab and Uttar Pradesh Assembly poll results speaks volumes on this.\nFrom March 4", "gen_completion": ", Kejriwal is campaigning for MCD polls and will address two election rallies on March 11 and 11, and five public meetings on 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.\nKejriwal was accompanied by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in these two rallies.

A diagnosis of chlamydia was reported in the zoo\u2019s peacock population.\nThe inspectors recommended Gill should face prosecution under the Animal Welfare Act for allowing animals to suffer, and said the entire blame for the attraction\u2019s problems could be laid at his door.\nA month later Gill was refused a licence to continue running the zoo, and the attraction is now in the hands of new owners, Cumbria Zoo Company Ltd. Gill has never been prosecuted and denies any wrongdoing.\nThe Guardian has learned that Gill is now planning to launch an American-themed horse-riding ranch in the hills of the Lake District.\nA planning application under the name David Rivera was submitted this month and looks likely to be approved by the Lake District National Park Authority, to the anger of animal rights campaigners.\nIn the first six months of 2016 alone at the zoo, five inca terns died from exposure, an alpaca died from hypothermia, a lemur drowned, a bird was euthanised after its beak was broken by a macaw, 13 other animals died from trauma and three died from starvation. A jaguar chewed off its own paw after damaging it on broken glass and exposed nails.\nIn June 2016, the zoo was fined \u00a3255,000 for health and safety breaches after the death of a keeper Sarah McClay, 24, who was mauled by a Sumatran tiger three years earlier.\nNicola O\u2019Brien, of the charity Freedom for Animals, said of the ranch plans: \u201cIt is outrageous that any local authority would give David Gill the opportunity to run another business with animals.\nGill\u2019s website promises a \u201cwestern-style world heritage horse experience\u201d, bringing \u201cwestern comfort and style to the Lake District for you to enjoy\u201d.

{"prefix": "Snipiskes has caused an international furor.\nVILNIUS - Human bones have been discovered centimeters below the surface of the Snipiskes grounds in central Vilnius.\nThe discovery would appear to back up claims that the site is within the boundaries of an old Jewish cemetery. The government had approved plans to build more luxury apartments on a site that has already been built on, a plan which has outraged the Jewish community.\nHowever Zenonas Baubonis, the head of the Lithuanian Archeological Society, which carried out the dig, said the bones cannot be treated as burials.\nBaubonis said that the archeological survey was intended to supplement material gathered by Israeli geophysicists and to determine the precise location and boundaries of the Jewish cemetery.\nThe original Geotec survey failed to verify the geophysical data and did not specify the boundaries of the old cemetery. The tests were suspended following demands of Jewish representatives who observed the dig.\nArcheologists who carried out the research said that the findings, including human bones, had been discovered at depths of 20 to 30 centimeters, while data provided by the coordinator of the geophysical tests, Arieh Klein, suggests that Israeli specialists had registered the depth at 1.5 meters.\nThe Lithuanian Archeological Society said in a letter that \"the discovered fragments of human bones makes it impossible to determine religious, cultural or ethnic dependence of the dead people,\" and that \"the unearthed layer with the findings may have formed from surrounding soil or may have been brought from other locations as construction ruins.\"\nThe senior state inspector of the Cultural Heritage Department, Renaldas Augustinavicius, reported that the archeological tests would be resumed in September. He said Jewish experts had not yet decided on further actions regarding the human bones discovered on the first day of digging.\nTesting was halted after the first bone fragments were found. Having found fragments of human and animal bones, the Lithuanian archeologists could no longer continue their activities due to objections by the monitors.\nChaim Birshtein, a Jewish Community leader in Lithuania agrees with the stopping of surveying. \"Jewish or not, all people's bones should be preserved,\" he told The Baltic Times.\n\"By finding the bones, it is proven that this is a cemetery. Whatever has been damaged has been damaged and we just want the bones to lie there in peace now,\" Birshtein added.\nHe is, however, outspoken about possible conspiracies against the community, saying, \"They don't want to show the truth to everybody.\"\nNews of the halted tests was announced by the Cultural Heritage Department, which said that \"fragments of household ceramics and shattered glass, parts of metal items, single human and animal bones not in anatomical positions,\" were found some 20 to 30 centimeters under the surface.\nSpecialists have so far refused to specify whether the discovered remains were Jewish, saying certain tests would still be carried out because the remains were \"not in anatomical positions,\"", "gen_completion": " according to the report.\nExperts told The Baltic Times that if the remains were human remains, they would be analyzed, and DNA tests would not be necessary.

Food and Agriculture Organisation, malnutrition costs the global economy as much as five percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), equivalent to 3.5 trillion dollars annually or 500 dollars a person. Impact for Agriculture noted that over 200 million people go hungry and 40 percent of children under age five are stunted due to malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa today.\n\u201cTwin believes that incorporating food safety into the food security and nutrition goals will create the impetus to develop novel finance mechanisms in post-harvest drying and storage for households and communities as well as formal value chains,\u201d Emmott says, explaining that this approach should seek to improve food safety, reduce food waste, support local food systems and make food more readily available for longer periods over the year.\nHoevel and Emmott agree that in structuring the new goals, the development of markets for smallholder farmers is essential.", "gen_completion": " The U.N.

He said that in the last 10 years since Saddam Hussein was toppled, 1026 members of his congregation had been killed \u2013 58 within one day.\nWhite said that in the last decade, Iraq's Christian population had shrunk from 1.5 million to around 200,000.\nAs Egypt adapts to its second regime change in two years, Bishop Angaelos, leader of the Coptic Church in the UK, said Egyptians are beginning to embrace their identity as Egyptians, rather than only as part of a group of distinct communities.\n\"It was unheard of before two years ago that Egyptian flags would be flying on the streets because people felt that they were not really part of a single nation state, so they reverted to their own religion, whether Christian or Muslim,\" he said.\nThe Bishop said that one Muslim Brotherhood leader said he felt closer to an Indonesian Muslim than a Coptic Christian because of the concept of the nation of Islam, the Ummah.\nIn this way, he said former President Mohamed Morsi's religious-led government had highlighted the distinctions between the different faith communities, rather than brought people together.\n\"We looked at what happened two years ago as the turning point, but... there was a mentality of divide and conquer, which means that you keep communities apart; you make them think that they can't trust each other.\n\"You don't bring people together at all, because if you bring people together, you get what's happening on the streets of Cairo today, which was impossible back then.

The program has been referred to as the Oscars of coffee and seeks to identify the best beans from many of the top coffee farms in the world. An international jury of professional coffee tasters is invited to the host country to cup the selected entries. Cup of Excellence competitions have been held in Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Rwanda, Costa Rica and Colombia.\nOn the first day of the competition there is an extensive calibration. During the next two days, the international jury cups the coffees that have been approved and passed by the national jury. On the fourth day, the jury cups about 45 coffees which have passed the first round. Coffees scoring an 84 or above during this round are awarded the prestigious Cup of Excellence.\nThe top ten scoring coffees are ranked again to discover the first place winner of the competition. Winning Cup of Excellence coffees are then sold through an internet auction. The most recent auction was held on January 18th, for the winning farms of the 2010 Brazilian competition. I was thrilled to see two of my friends receive the top two awards. Cl\u00e1udio Carneiro Pinto's Grota S\u00e3o Pedro farm was awarded first place. His coffee sold for $25.05 per pound. Carlos Segio Sanglard's Serra do Bone took second place. His coffee fetched $12.10 per pound.

The coffees were phenomenally clean, sweet, aromatic and delicious!\n\"While I was a consultant outside of the roasting/retail business, I became involved with a United Nations project that was trying to develop higher quality coffees in order to sell at higher premiums. So when specialty coffee was really growing (1990's), and there were many success stories, farmers were not feeling the benefit of that at all. That's when I co-founded the Cup of Excellence, which was an international competition where we brought in roasters from Japan, Europe, The Americas and around the world to taste coffees. That suddenly really raised the price and also brought attention and identity to single farmers for the first time, so within two to three years, entire regions -- not only farmers, but regions -- were being discovered. Brazil had always been discounted as being poor producers of quality. Suddenly they became desirable, their prices went up. Individual farms were able to make connections to roasters and roasters to farmers. So now you had Europeans, Japanese and Americans coming to Brazil to visit those farms and buy at higher premiums.\"\nI recently interviewed Cup of Excellence's other co-founder, Susie Spindler and asked her how she sees CoE as improving coffee quality. Here was her response.\n[\"The] Cup of Excellence program has improved quality by giving farmers a financial incentive to do the best job they can.

{"prefix": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Federal regulators on Friday adopted a new system of special fees paid by U.S. financial institutions that will shift more of the burden to bigger banks to help replenish the deposit insurance fund.\nThe move by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. cut by about two-thirds the amount of special fees to be levied on banks and thrifts. It followed protests by small and community banks \u2014 with powerful allies in Congress \u2014 against a plan adopted in February that charged premiums based on the amount of deposits. The smaller institutions insisted they would be unfairly hit even though they didn\u2019t contribute to the financial crisis with reckless lending.\nThe FDIC board voted 4-1 to approve the new fee system. It is intended to raise $5.6 billion in the face of a cascade of bank failures that have depleted the insurance fund. The lone dissent came from U.S. Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan, whose agency regulates national banks.\nThe FDIC received more than 14,000 comment letters on the earlier fee plan. Typical of the anger was the letter from Dean Anderson, vice president of Lake Elmo Bank.\nThe American Bankers Association, the industry\u2019s biggest lobbying group, was happy to claim credit Friday for the FDIC\u2019s course change.\nBecause larger financial institutions tend to rely more on funding from sources other than deposits, bigger banks would end up paying a heftier portion of the new assessment.

{"prefix": "A new study suggests that the death toll from drug overdoses in America is much more severe than initially believed.\nIn December, the CDC said 52,404 people had died from drug overdoses in 2015, with over 60% dying from opioids (prescription painkillers) and heroin. Overdose numbers have been rising for years, but new research published Monday in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine suggests that those rates were dramatically underreported.\nOne reason for the gap? In many overdose cases, no specific drug is identified as the cause on the death certificate. Between 1999 and 2014, up to one in four drug overdose deaths had no single drug listed as the cause.\nThat doesn't mean researchers who want to correct the figures are out of luck, however. Even in cases in which no specific drug is listed as the single cause of death, officials often do list at least one category of drug present in the person's body based on screenings they do at the time. For the latest study, the researchers used that information to correct the data they had on drug overdoses.\nNationally, the \"corrected\" death rate (using the new paper's method) from opioid painkillers was 24% greater than reported rates in 2014; the rate for heroin was 22% higher.\nIn the states where gaps between reported and actual death rates were greatest \u2014 Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Louisiana \u2014 the percentages differed by up to 108%.\nThese results change the face of the US drug overdose epidemic substantially, as can be seen on the maps below. Reported overdose deaths for opioids and heroin are on the left; corrected deaths are on the right.\nThe corrected figures suggest that deaths from opioids were much more concentrated in the Mountain states, Rust Belt, and Industrial North \u2014 extending to New England \u2014 as well as much of the South. Heroin deaths, on the other hand, were highest in the Northeast and Rust Belt states, but had less of an effect on the South or Mountain states.\n\"Current death certificate data are problematic for understanding the drug poisoning epidemic, with a particular issue being the frequency with which no specific drug is identified,\" wrote Christopher J. Ruhm, the author of the paper and a professor at the University of Virginia, in the paper.\nThe new analysis comes just four months after an investigation by a field officer for the CDC also suggested that the death toll was higher than originally believed.\nVictoria Hall, a CDC field officer, and her Minnesota-based team reviewed a decade of death records submitted to the Minnesota Department of Health's Unexplained Death (UNEX) surveillance system.\nHall, who presented the results on Monday at a CDC conference, found that of the 1,676 UNEX deaths between 2006 and 2015, approximately 3.5% had some complications due to opioid use. Those deaths were never filed as opioid-related deaths, despite some autopsies showing toxic or", "gen_completion": " fatal doses of opioids that could have ruled them as so. Additionally, in many cases, there was no way to classify the toxic substance in death records.\nHall noted that her team focused primarily on deaths involving people younger than 24, and that the \"size and frequency\" of the opioid deaths she measured were at least on the lower end of the estimated numbers in the CDC report. She said the CDC report focused on only deaths involving illicit substances like heroin or prescription opioids, which are \"far more toxic\" than street drugs like heroin, that typically last much longer in a person's body than street drugs like meth, which can be fatal in as little as three days.\n\"These are people we were focused on,\" Hall said, adding that her team went through \"thousands of lab records\" looking for links to specific opioids that could lead to complications. \"That has a larger effect on the overall death rate when you aren't accounting for deaths for opioids.\"\nBut Hall said she didn"}

A vote on the proposed cuts, which include cross country, golf, tennis, wrestling, lacrosse and slow-pitch softball, will be June 13.\n\"Part of that is it's a little too early to tell what the impact is going to be... are they going to be able to put some of those back through the help of some outside organizations, it's a little too early,\" he said. \"We've been the fastest growing school district in the state the past four years (percentage-wise). Rapid growth and an influx of students is something we're used to.

On Wednesday, Fox recommended to the school board that cutting 10 varsity sports would save $445,298.\nThat could send students scrambling for private schools or into surrounding counties to continue their careers. In addition to the high school sports, junior varsity soccer and two undetermined middle school sports will also be purged. According to the Florida Times-Union, the high school cuts alone would eliminate sports that 2,054 athletes competed in during the 2010-11 year.\nFlorida High School Athletic Association executive director Roger Dearing said that if the situation in Duval County plays out as is being projected, students couldn't just pick up and leave a program because of a sport not being offered there anymore.\n\"We would not ease the transfer rules,\" said Dearing, referring to Article 9 in the FHSAA bylaws about which covers student eligibility.\n\"They can't put on their application that they want", "gen_completion": " to transfer and for the reason they're leaving.

He was just gone.\nHis cell was too small to lie down. He was fed once a day. He could hear other prisoners being tortured. After three months, he had lost 60 pounds. He was then asked, \u201cAre you sorry for what you did?\u201d He hadn\u2019t done anything, but he said, \u201cI am sorry.\u201d And just like that he was let go.\nHis parents knew they had to leave Syria. They escaped through Lebanon and came to where they had family in Memphis.\nRami arrived in Memphis in 2012. He did not speak a word of English, so he took ESL classes at the University of Memphis and spent a year learning English. His desire to be a doctor had not waned.\nBecause Rami had never graduated from college in a U.S. system, attending an American medical school was not an option. So he applied to a school in the Caribbean. He effectively had to start over, but he was determined, and he did very well.\nI met him through his cousin who cooks wonderful Syrian food at the Global Caf\u00e9 at Crosstown Concourse. I was shocked when I learned that this truly remarkable young doctor was stymied in moving on in his training to become a resident physician because of his circuitous path through medical school. His credentials do not match up the \u201cproper way,\u201d so training programs, including the one based at Church Health, are prohibited from offering him a position.\nIn Rami\u2019s case, I cannot even blame the bank. It would be a true tragedy except for his remarkable spirit. He doesn\u2019t blame anyone, not even his captors in Syria. He is just determined to be a doctor who will serve those who are un-served, either in Memphis or back in Syria.\nThere is some good news. A small hospital in the middle of Mississippi has found a way around the paperwork obstacles. If I am right, come March 15, there will be a way forward for Rami and his dream to become a physician. Until it actually happens, I will offer a prayer for him every day.\nThe issue is not just Rami. There are refugees, displaced workers, and victims of poverty all around us who have great talent that is going unrealized. We need those talents in Memphis, yet artificial barriers prevent these individuals from becoming fully engaged citizens.\nWe need everyone operating at their highest level of ability for Memphis to be fully extracted from the throes of poverty. It shouldn\u2019t", "gen_completion": " be hard to achieve that. It is just that the wheels on that mighty train have been derailed.\nI encourage Memphis health care providers to be more like Dr. William Carlos Williams, the Nobel Prize-winning black surgeon who once served patients without regard to creed or gender.

{"prefix": "DANANG, Vietnam \u2014 Alex Huff is hard to miss among the dozens of children in the cafeteria at Phan Thanh elementary school. Blond-haired, blue-eyed and towering over his classmates, his legs are so long that his knees nearly touch his chest as he sits at a plastic table slurping up beef-noodle soup and milk.\nIn a city that was home to one of the largest U.S. air bases of the Vietnam War, in a school where the portrait of the late communist leader Ho Chi Minh hangs on the wall, 11-year-old Alex is a symbol of how even the deepest wounds can heal. But it goes further than that.\nHis Vietnamese is so good that he has astonished the country by placing second in a national storytelling competition that is as prestigious here as the National Spelling Bee in the United States. He is believed to be the first foreigner to do it.\nSince kindergarten, Alex has been the lone Westerner surrounded by a sea of Vietnamese children. His parents, Bob and Kathleen Huff, moved here more than five years ago from DeQueen, Ark., to work with disabled children. With no international school in the area, they enrolled their son in a kindergarten where no English was spoken. He later spent two years in a school in Hanoi before the family moved back to Danang.\nAt first, it was hard. The other children, who had rarely seen a Westerner, liked to stare as he labored over his lessons, or to rush up and touch his skin. Then he discovered that in Vietnam, too, they play tag and hide-and-seek, and he started to make friends.\nBut Vietnamese is devilishly hard to master. Although its alphabet is Romanized, it has six distinct tones, each of which can change the meaning of a word. The tones are what give the language its singsong musicality.\nAmericans started arriving in Vietnam in the 1990s as the country sought, like China, to open up to market forces without abandoning communist one-party rule. Some, like the Huffs, came to work with children. Others came to do business.\nAfter signing a pact normalizing trade relations in 2001, the United States and Vietnam last year had record two-way trade totaling about $2 billion. Companies like Nike have turned \u201cMade in Vietnam\u201d into a fixture in American malls, and Vietnam ships a lot of seafood to the U.S. market.\nToday, an estimated 2,700 Americans live in Vietnam, mostly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, which both offer international schools. Danang in central Vietnam, 470 miles south of Hanoi, doesn\u2019t have that option. So Alex\u2019s three-story school next to an old Buddhist temple is an open-air affair with no air conditioning to keep the heat and humidity at bay.\nDanang was a base from which American warplanes took off for combat during the Vietnam War. Viet Cong guerrillas regularly rocketed the Marines\u2019 helicopter base a few miles to the south.\nNow the streets that once teemed with U.S. soldiers offer everything from Internet cafes to tour companies and clothing shops. The city of 700,000 is a constant symphony of construction noise, swarms of beeping motorbikes and people chatting or eating on the sidewalks.\nOverlooking China Beach, once a favorite for GIs on leave, is the five-star Furama Resort hotel with marble floors and tiled swimming pools.\nYet Danang maintains a small-town charm. A typical sight is schoolgirls on bicycles wearing the traditional ao dais, a flowing white tunic.\nAlex says he feels most at home in Vietnam.\nLe Nguyen Van Anh and Alex were", "gen_completion": " in kindergarten when they met in school.

And he won a place at the national finals of an international, English literacy competition and earned a spot in the top three.

Stubblefield, drummer Roy Berry and keyboardist Rick Steff \u2014 self-financed its latest album and will release it on their own Liberty & Lament imprint (which is distributed through Thirty Tigers). The disc arrives as Lucero marks 20 years together.\nThe making of \u201cAmong the Ghosts\u201d brought changes to the band\u2019s working methodology. Lucero\u2019s last three LP were cut at Midtown\u2019s Ardent studio with British producer Ted Hutt (Gaslight Anthem, Old Crow Medicine Show) behind the board. This time, the band elected to move to Sam Phillips Recording Service and co-produce the album themselves with local Grammy-winning engineer Matt Ross-Spang.\n\u201cPhillips is actually two doors down from our practice space,\u201d Nichols says. \u201cWe\u2019d worked there before, with [legendary producer] Roland Janes back in the day. But this time, we wanted to take a different approach to how we made it as compared to the last few records, and do it in a little bit more of a laid-back Memphis environment with Matt, who\u2019s a Memphis kid.\nRather than work for several weeks straight, the band instead did a series of hit and run sessions between tours: 10 days to start, then three days here, another five days there.\nThe disc also marks the first project without sax man Jim Spake, who left after several years and records as part of an expanded Lucero lineup.\n\u201cLucero has always been the kind of band that adapts to whatever is available at the time,\u201d Nichols says. \u201cWhen the horns were there, it was a lot of fun, and we were after that Stax Records soulful direction. But Spake didn\u2019t want to be on the road anymore, so we ended up being back to a five piece \u2014 the four original members and [keyboardist] Rick Steff, who\u2019s been with us for over 10 years now.\nNichols notes there is a shared influence and inspiration between him and his younger cinematic sibling. \u201cThere\u2019s been some crossover there for sure.

{"prefix": "It's a well-known fact that some of our favourite seafoods come with an unsavoury dose of heavy metals like mercury. But there's another group of chemicals that sometimes lace our tuna steaks, and the latest findings on them are anything but appetising. They're called persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and they do a bang-up job obstructing the human body's chemical defence system. That's according to an analysis published today in Science Advances, examining how ten POPs found in both tuna and human bodily fluids interact with a gatekeeper protein that shuttles unwanted toxins out of our cells. The findings suggest that ingesting even very small quantities of POPs can do bodily harm.\n\"These chemicals interfere with our chemical defence system's ability to operate, which can make us more vulnerable to drugs and other toxins,\" Amro Hamdoun, a biologist at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and lead author on the study, told Gizmodo.\nPOPs have been around for a long, long time. One of the most infamous, the pesticide DDT, was developed during World War II. DDT was banned in the 1970s, but other POPs, including flame retardants and non-stick coatings, are still widely used today. While these chemicals are damn useful in many applications, they're a toxicologist's nightmare. They degrade very slowly in the environment, they accumulate in biological tissues and they have been been linked to everything from impaired neural development to obesity.\nHamdoun's study sheds new light on POP toxicity by demonstrating, for the first time, exactly how these chemicals shut down a key cellular defence system. Normally, foreign molecules are kicked out of our cells by a special transporter known as P-glycoprotein (Pg-p). \"Pg-p is a bit like a bouncer,\" Hamdoun said. \"Initially, we thought that these chemicals sneak past the bouncer. But what we found is that they actually form very intimate interactions with Pg-p.\"\nLaboratory tests revealed that ten of the most widespread POPs all bind tightly to this protective protein, inhibiting its ability to do its job. Even at levels where POPs themselves pose no hazard, \"they're interfering with the very systems and pathways that have evolved to protect us,\" Amro said.\nLevels of POPs in the environment are on the decline. But the ocean is a big place, and industry leaves a long legacy. \"The bottom line is, there are still reservoirs of these in the ocean,\" Amro said. \"And we are still being exposed to them through the consumption of seafood.\"\nWhich types of seafood and which part of the ocean", "gen_completion": " pose the greatest risk? The study isn't all about POPs' threat as a biological system, though.

The study suggests that these chemicals may also have undesirable effects on our hormonal systems.\nPEDS can interfere with protein trafficking to our blood vessels. \"The study supports the idea that the proteins are also part of the problem,\" Hamdoun said. \"If you're altering the proteins in such a way as to affect something that the body uses, that could have downstream consequences for endocrine systems and for health. We can also make sense of it in terms of the toxicity burden.\"\nSo"}

Michaels, unlike many of the kooky climate contrarians that Republicans often dig up to, actually has some bona fides.

And unlike some of his fellow skeptics, Michaels will acknowledge that the earth is warming\u2014he just doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal, nor will he agree that human activity is the major contributing factor.\nBut Michaels is loathe to admit how much of his income over the years has come from fossil fuel interests, despite evidence that he\u2019s taken quite a bit of it. In his letter to Upton on Monday, Waxman raises the question of whether Michaels \u201cmay have provided misleading information about the sources of his funding and his ties to industries opposed to regulation of emissions responsible for climate change\u201d when he testified before the committee in February 2009.\nIn his curriculum vitae (PDF) provided to the committee at that time, under the section \u201cFinancial Support (Over $10,000),\u201d Michaels listed $4.2 million in income, attributing just 3 percent of it to industry sources\u2014excluding several major industry sources that have been disclosed in the course of litigation, including New Hope Environmental Services, Intermountain Rural Electric Association (IREA), Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc., and the free-market think-tank the Heartland Institute.\nAsked about whether he is funded by the oil industry in an appearance on CNN last August, Michaels first responded, \u201cNot largely.\u201d He was then asked how much of his funding comes from oil interests, to which he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, 40 percent.\u201d That, as Waxman writes", "gen_completion": ", \u201cdoes constitute an attempt to minimize the possible appearance that one\u2019s position on climate policy has some financial slant.\u201d\nIn his letter, Waxman asks Upton to keep close tabs on the relationship Michaels\u2019 firm has with the coal companies, particularly the state of Wyoming\u2019s public utilities commission, which decided to allow the state\u2019s utilities company to buy coal mines from the coal mines owned by Michaels\u2019 firm, New Hope Coal Inc., in August, at a cost of over a quarter-billion dollars.

In a report on its earlier activities to improve Russia ties in 2013-2015, CNI outlined meetings it had taken with Obama administration officials during a time when Barack Obama himself pursued a similar policy. The meeting took place near the end of that time, in April 2015. The meeting was ostensibly set up to discuss Torshin\u2019s new appointment as deputy central bank governor.\nThe timing of this meeting seems significant. By this time, Russia had annexed Crimea more than a year earlier, and overtly invaded eastern Ukraine seven months prior to the meeting. Sanctions had already been applied to Russia, but Obama still wanted to pursue friendlier ties. Torshin\u2019s meeting with Fischer could be explained as a way to coordinate banking systems, but sending an undersecretary of state to a meeting with Torshin signals something more significant.\nHowever, the streak of presidential na\u00efvet\u00e9 on Vladimir Putin didn\u2019t start there, and it didn\u2019t end there either. Butina\u2019s presence as a potential spy is certainly interesting, but so is Torshin\u2019s, who also figures into the \u201cit was the NRA\u2019s fault\u201d narrative. If the Obama administration was granting her and Torshin access to the Undersecretary for International Affairs, it\u2019s tough to blame the NRA or the GOP for a lack of due diligence in engaging with either one of them.

I didn't know that,\" Trump said.\nTrump was referring to a scathing speech delivered last week by 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who sought to undermine Trump's success in this year's campaign by outlining what he called the billionaire's business failures.\n\"Whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there's Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks, and Trump Mortgage?\" said Romney. \"A business genius he is not.\"\nRomney didn't make reference to Trump's defunct bottled water company, Trump Ice, in his remarks. But Trump nonetheless gestured to cases of Trump-branded \"Natural Spring Water,\" bottles of which are available at his hotels and golf clubs.\n\"He talked about the water company. Well, there's the water company. I mean, we sell water. And we have water, and it's a very successful, you know, it's a private little water company, and I supply the water for all my places, and it's good. But it's very good, \"Trump said.\nTrump also touted a long list of his other assets, including the Trump International Golf Club in Jupiter, where friends and club members had gathered for the event. He stressed that he owns it and several other clubs outright, and they're all debt-free.\nTrump then moved onto the steaks.\n\"Trump steaks, where are the steaks? Do we have the steaks?\" he said. \"We have Trump steaks. And by the way, you want to take one, we charge you about, what, 50 bucks a steak?\"\nBut you can't buy \"Trump Steaks,\" not anymore. The ones Romney mentioned in his speech were sold exclusively by The Sharper Image stores in 2007, in a venture that quickly fizzled.\nA page on the company's website now reads, \"Unfortunately, Trump Steaks are no longer available, but their legacy endures. And, whether you think Donald Trump's candidacy is", "gen_completion": " a hoax or a scam, these are items that helped raise the Republican candidate for president. Enjoy your purchase of these items now in the Sharper Image stores!\"\nAt the news conference Tuesday, Trump was not asked if the steak display was a slight to Romney and to the business. But he said he would not defend them and that they are there \"to let people know we have something to sell.\" He added that they have been in business for more than 50 years.\n\"I just want to let you know that we have a lot to sell. I think we are really a very interesting company. I don't think we've done anything horrible. I just don't think we've done anything \u2014 remember I started with nothing. Not that long ago, \"said Trump. His company started with just a small real estate deal and a small hotel. The company has made money.\"\nCopyright 2017 AP. All rights reserved.

However, over the years, lo-fi has somewhat become a standard genre of music that is known to be popular amongst \u201cbedroom musicians\u201d or people producing music from their homes as opposed to studios.\nLo-fi was heavily criticised by both critics and the general audience when it first came onto the scene. The so-called \u201clo-fi aesthetic\u201d would arise unintentionally during sound engineering and was characterised as being undesirable. Some of the first musicians to experiment with lo-fi did so somewhat by accident. The likes of Paul McCartney, The Beach Boys, Beck, and Robert Stevie Moore were among the first. Moore is today regarded as one of the pioneers of the genre.\nOut of all the artists associated with lo-fi back then, only Moore was producing music in his home, which ultimately resulted in the overall aesthetic. While Moore's name isn't known as widely, his work has influenced Beck, Guided by Voices, and Ariel Pink.\nBy the start of the 1990s, lo-fi would become a radio mainstay by finding a place in the grunge scene. Grunge musicians wanted their music to sound rough and low effort. The \u201caesthetic\u201d would prove to be as important in the grunge scene as the music itself.\nMoving forward, lo-fi found itself a new home in jazz rap, a genre filled with producers sampling classic jazz artists. Selectively sampling parts from 50s jazz and then looping it endlessly became a common industry practice in jazz rap.\nSo, where is lo-fi now? It's still here and has finally become a genre in its own right. Developments in technology over the past two decades has given rise to more bedroom musicians and created the electronic musician. The rise of personal computers and modern production capabilities has allowed more and more people to start dabbling in the genre by producing tracks from multiple samples.\nBut how did lo-fi finally make it into the mainstream? As music continued to evolve, demand arose at the turn of the last century for a different kind of music.\nThe purpose of a lo-fi track in this day and age is to be a simple song that you don't need to think about while you're listening to it. It's just the same sample (usually the best part) played on repeat over a beat with some effects such as that of a cassette deck or vinyl scratches added into the mix.", "gen_completion": " Essentially it's a good time.\nSo, what about today? In order to understand what lo-fi is, we'll also have to know a little about hi-fi. The high-quality electronics from the 1950s which was synonymous with audio quality started to fade away after the early 1960s. The end of the 60s also saw a decline in the demand for more hi-fi products in favour of the consumer preference for more compact machines.\nThis was the time when vinyl and CD arrived as a method of music distribution. The end result brought in hi-fi products that were better known to the public but it didn't necessarily mean that they were better than the previous hi-fi products.\nThe biggest reason for this was their excessive price point as compared to the cheap CDs from the time. When the high-end hi-fi items started to come to the mainstream for the first time, people began to use them just for being on the edge and to hear the end"}

{"prefix": "2 What Is the Percent of Profit Margin That Retailers Expect From Jewelry?\n4 What Is a Reasonable Profit Margin?\nProperty management companies range from gargantuan firms that manage thousands of apartments, shopping malls and commercial complexes to small firms that specialize in vacation rentals with only 10 or so houses. Whether small or large, increasing profits is a goal. If you're considering starting a property management company or improving your own property management business, there are several ways you can do so and turn a profit.\nIncrease the number of properties, and your revenues will increase. If the operating margins are maintained, each additional property results in an additional percentage falling to profits. For example, if each property generates $10,000 in revenues and has a 35 percent gross margin -- the percentage of expenses related to that property -- then $6,500 of additional profit is generated.\nProperty management services include such efforts as marketing, maintenance, and renting out or selling the use of the property. Providing additional services results in additional profits as long as your expenses for providing the service are lower than the revenues generated. An apartment complex property management company could offer concierge services to the renters. A vacation home rental company might decide to have personalized meet-and-greet upon check-in.\nBroadening the types of properties is an alternative way to increase profits. If your business handles short-term sub-leases for apartments, you could offer that same service for townhouses and condos.\nProperty management companies generate revenues from the owners of the properties they manage and from the guests, renters or lessees who occupy the properties. Increasing rates to the owners when management contracts are up for renewal increases revenues and therefore profits. Keep in mind that current owners may decide to contract with someone else if the rate increase is too high. The rates generated from the guests or those who pay to occupy the properties also can be increased.\nRevenues are generated by the rate or fee for occupying the space times the number of spaces occupied. In the case of an apartment building where each apartment leases for $500 per month and 200", "gen_completion": " additional units are built into the development, the owners get to keep $300 each month for themselves because they control the rent revenue. However, instead of $300 going to the owners, it might keep going to people who rent the apartments and then continue to pay to occupy them.\nAs long as rates are set in the contract, increases to the rates do not lead to costs increases for the occupants or rate of occupancy for the buildings. If rates are not set in contracts and the owners get no profit, any increases to rates must be in the contract. If owners don't want to pay more, they need to keep the same rates or find another owner willing to sell the properties. Remember that if rates are set in prior to occupancy, owners have the right to raise the rates charged to all the occupants. You don't want that to happen as a property management company or a vacation rental agency as it could lead to an exodus in less profitable markets.\nProperty management companies also have to factor"}

Just 15 percent acquire a 4-year degree, according to analyses by Doug Shapiro and Afet Dundar at the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.\nThe degree of alignment and integration between community and four-year colleges is much greater in some states than others.

Whitaker, the nation\u2019s new acting attorney general, repeatedly chided presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in public statements during 2016 while he was speaking for a group that is barred by its tax-exempt status from supporting or opposing political candidates during a campaign.\nBefore coming to the Justice Department in 2017, Whitaker was president and executive or of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a charitable organization that styles itself as nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group \u2014 known by its initials, FACT \u2014 is supposed to serve the public interest under Section 501c3 of the U.S. tax code, without directly or even indirectly supporting or opposing specific candidates for office.\nYet the group has engaged in one partisan pronouncement after another, mostly directed at Democrats. During the last presidential race, Whitaker argued in July 2016 newspaper opinion pieces that Clinton should be prosecuted for her handling of her private email server \u2014 a favourite talking point of Donald Trump. The opinion pieces identified Whitaker as FACT\u2019s leader.\nIn September 2016, Whitaker argued that Clinton had acted shamelessly by appointing her charity\u2019s donors to boards of the State Department when she was secretary of state.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the history of our country that served in the administration has been this bold in their private fundraising and their sort of giving favours,\u201d he said in a radio interview posted on YouTube by his group.\nDaniel Borochoff, president of CharityWatch, a Chicago-based group that monitors the non-profit world, said that statement appears to violate the IRS ban on engagement for or against a particular political candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s highly critical of a candidate, and he ought not to be doing that, because it\u2019s a political partisan comment,\u201d he said.\nWhitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, left FACT in October 2017 to become Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 chief of staff. He was named this week by President Trump to take over at least temporarily for Sessions, who resigned at Trump\u2019s request.\nIn 2015 and 2016, Whitaker earned a total of $654,000 from FACT \u2014 30 per cent of its entire spending of $2.2 million over that two-year span. His 2016 salary was $402,000; the average CEO or executive director at 380 advocacy or education charities in that year made a salary of $173,099, according to Matthew J. Viola, a vice-president at Charity Navigator.\nBorochoff suggested that Whitaker\u2019s board of directors at FACT didn\u2019t appear to be independent enough to apply the brakes on his campaign partisanship. Whitaker appeared to exert tight control over a three-person board of directors that included just one unsalaried member, according to the group\u2019s IRS filings in 2015-16.\nWhitaker\u2019s foundation was initially formed and", "gen_completion": " registered in 2005 by Harold Ickes, who would become Trump\u2019s first ethics lawyer, and Michael L.

It ultimately raised millions of dollars.\nBy 2009-10, the foundation\u2019s donors had donated $12.6 million \u2014 primarily to FACT, which had raised $20.1 million by that year.\nIckes and Zeldin transferred a handful of FACT board members into the foundation in 2010 and created a secret committee at FACT for \u201ctransparency\u201d that made up \u201cmost of the board,\u201d according to ethics filings at SEC.

LOUIS \u2014 Once in awhile, in my role as a movie critic, other grand opportunities present themselves and my fortuitous meeting with \u201cPawn Sacrifice\u2019s\u201d producer at an industry cocktail party rates as one such opportunity.\nThe St. Louis Chess Club, located in the city\u2019s Central West End, sponsored the party Sept. 3, prior to the St. Louis red carpet premier of the movie \u201cPawn Sacrifice\u201d starring Tobey Maguire, as American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer.\nThe film is about chess Grand Master Bobby Fischer\u2019s triumphant win over Russian Boris Spassky at the 1972 World Championship in Reykjavik, Iceland. The film\u2019s producer, Gail Katz, was present at the party to promote the film.\nI asked if I could have a couple of minutes to talk with Katz. I was delighted that I had her all to myself for almost a half hour. When she walked in the room, she had the attention of every woman present. She was tall and thin, with long hair peppered with gray, and looked very elegant in a chic black cocktail dress trimmed in black leather.\nKatz has a BA in economics from the University of California Berkeley and a MBA from the Yale School of Management.

She said that she thought she might end up working on Wall Street but that she was raised in Beverly Hills and worked at a studio one summer while in college.\nShe got \u201chooked on film,\u201d she said.\nKatz heads Gail Katz Productions. She has worked at New World Pictures, where she was Vice President of Finance, then Vice President of Production. After leaving New World, Katz began producing films, starting with \u201cShattered.\u201d She partnered with director Wolfgang Petersen throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, together the two directed/produced many films.\nShe has served as CEO of Radiant Productions, and as a founder of Red Cliff Productions. She was an executive producer on the ABC drama/comedy \u201cCashmere Mafia,\u201d which Gail Katz Productions produced. Currently, Katz is an adjunct professor at the USC School of Cinematic Arts.\nAs a producer, Katz is responsible for everything from conceiving or finding the idea; securing financing; hiring writers, actors, directors, staff and crews; marketing; and distribution.\nI asked how she came up with the idea for \u201cPawn Sacrifice.\u201d She said that in 1972 she worked at her father\u2019s caf\u00e9 in Los Angeles and on the way home every night they turned on the radio to hear how Bobby Fischer did that day.\nShe pitched the idea to two writers who were on board immediately. They came up with the storyline, she recalled.\nTobey Maguire was always her first choice to play Bobby. She thinks he even looks like Bobby Fischer. Liev Schreiber, who plays Boris Spassky, also bears a strong resemblance to Spassky.\nKatz hired David Fincher to direct but Fincher had so many commitments that the start of filming kept getting put off, she said. After two years, Fincher graciously bowed out so Katz could hire Edward Zwick to direct.\nKatz said that the art director and costume designer did an awesome job of recreating the 1960s.

There have been 68 men and one woman executed in Georgia since 1976, CBS affiliate WGCL reports.\nSallie was the 46th inmate put to death by lethal injection, according to officials.\nSallie was convicted of murder in the fatal shooting of John Lee Moore in March 1990. His first conviction and death sentence were overturned because his attorney had a conflict of interest.\nAt his second trial in 2001, a woman eventually chosen as a juror lied during jury selection and failed to disclose domestic violence, messy divorces and a child custody battle that were \u201cbizarrely similar\u201d to Sallie\u2019s case, his lawyers said. They add she later bragged to his attorneys\u2019 investigator that she persuaded her divided peers to vote unanimously for death.\nThe defense team made those arguments in a clemency petition to the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, urging it to act as a \u201cfail safe\u201d against a miscarriage of justice. But the board, the only authority in Georgia with power to commute a death sentence, declined to spare Sallie\u2019s life following a clemency hearing Monday.\nSallie\u2019s lawyers asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the scheduled execution, but it declined. They argued that the high court\u2019s ruling in a pending Texas case with ineffective counsel issues could remove the procedural bars that are keeping the lower federal courts from considering their juror-bias claims.\nAttorneys for the state have argued the Texas case isn\u2019t similar enough that its outcome would affect Sallie, particularly because that case doesn\u2019t involve a federal petition that wasn\u2019t filed on time. Furthermore, they argue, even if the issues were identical, the federal appeals court in Atlanta is bound by its own precedent - which doesn\u2019t allow such an extraordinary admission of the procedurally barred evidence - and not by the future possibility of new precedent from the Supreme Court.\nSallie\u2019s lawyers also have argued in a state court petition that carrying out his execution would violate his constitutional rights. Lawyers for the state rejected those claims and a court dismissed the petition. Sallie\u2019s lawyers appealed to the state Supreme Court, which on Tuesday declined to stop his scheduled execution. His lawyers appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court which also declined Tuesday evening to stop his execution.\nAt the time of the killing, Sallie\u2019s wife was living with her parents in rural south Georgia after having filed for divorce and after the two had fought bitterly over custody of their young son.\nAfter cutting his in-laws\u2019 phone lines and breaking into their house about 12", "gen_completion": ":30 a.m. March 20, 1990, Sallie drove to the home of Moore, their longtime, friendly neighbor about 16 miles away, hid behind a shed and gunned down his wife\u2019s father-in-law with a.357 revolver he already had in his possession from another gunfight the two had in January.

That one cleverly used a family breakup to explore Scotland\u2019s independence movement.\nLazy Fair looks at the execution and aftermath of a heist somewhere in the world (Paul Tei\u2019s costumes suggest the Middle East). The caper plays out in flashback. In the present, a decade after the theft went all kinds of wrong, the three plotters reunite and turn on each other.\nRip (Ken Clement) is the conniving ringleader who wound up with the spoils: what looks like an empty box, though Monkey assures him it contains the spirit of money. Otto (Andy Quiroga), a tightly wound worrier, suffers from memory lapses because of an injury he suffered in the bomb blast 10 years earlier \u2014 at least, that\u2019s how Rip tells it. Sandra (Meredith Bartmon) has remained friendly with Otto, but she has a tendency to vanish and reappear. As for Rip, he\u2019s dead to her, and she\u2019d like to make that literal.\nThe three rationalize their crime initially by deciding the rich have way too much money, so a little redistribution of wealth is in order. Otto frets that money will change their friendship, and he\u2019s right. There is talk of Super PACs, the sub-prime mortgage collapse, the Sinaloa Cartel, ponzi schemes, the Koch brothers. The idea that friends shouldn\u2019t discuss money comes up more than once.\nLazy Fair is a relatively short play overstuffed with ideas. Though Reyna, a gifted theater artist, writes good dialogue, the beginning of the play is so deliberately puzzling that the audience takes too long to get invested in the characters and story. Since Reyna is also acting in the play, Lazy Fair might have benefitted (as so many first productions do) from having someone", "gen_completion": " else come in to edit and speed matters up.

It may not be a good idea for her to appear as a woman in what could be an older woman\u2019s play because it does make the characters feel more as if they\u2019re speaking directly to female friends than to a male audience. Lazy Fair can feel pretty heavy and the characters are a lot to keep up with.\nLazy Fair can benefit from a better cut-through by writing a much, much shorter script \u2014 just a bit shorter than The Scottish Play.

In fact, you'll have a hard time finding anything else.\nSo when Elle magazine offered the cover to Melissa McCarthy (The Heat, Bridesmaids) for its \"The Women in Hollywood\" issue, many were happy to see a bigger woman finally chosen for the cover. But now that the magazine has unveiled a look at it, we see that the actress is wearing a heavy coat that's covering almost every inch of her.\nCritics immediately attacked Elle for their wardrobe decision, but the magazine says that McCarthy had lots of input into what she would be wearing. \"Melissa loved this look, and is gorgeous on our cover,\" said Elle.\nTake a look at the cover below and let us know if the magazine should be ashamed for covering up McCarthy.\nThey should be ashamed for putting her on the cover. Period!\nI can't f*cking stand this unfunny irl Miss Piggy, she's terrible.\nA wise choice indeed!!\nBullit beat me to it.\nWhen will people stop with forcing everyone to accept fat people? Everyone's up in arms if a girl is slightly underweight on one of these magazine covers, but they cream their pants when they get some 250lb cow on the cover.\nShe's fat, we get it and it's still not funny.\nWell f*cking said kickit! I'm sick of it!\nYou know what, and I hate to sound like a f*cking preacher here, but I am fine with people being who they are and all. That's great. But encouraging the idea of being overweight as something to be PROUD of it horrible! You know what will come from it! This girl will die by the age of 50 and that what role model will she be!

Fine be proud to be who you are, but when actual health issues fall with your lifestyle, don't f*cking promote it to other people.\nYeah, they should've treated her like every other actress on a magazine cover...just dress her up in a skimpy outfit and photoshop the f*ck out of her until she's impossibly perfect in a way that makes young girls develop eating disorders and yearn to commit suicide.\nDreamcast, just because you love fatties doesn't mean everyone else has to. No one's advocating eating disorders, but we're not advocating obesity either.\nActually, those hypocritical bastards from Elle mag should definitely have that annoying fatso taken pics of her just like every other girls before and that would have been epically fun!\nShow to the max how the annoying c*nt really looks like in a skimpy outfit.\nThey actually got her to fit on the cover?!!?\nThe article says Melissa McCarthy, so why am I looking at Roseanne Barr?\nThat's not a coat, it's a parachute.\nwatched The Heat.

Drudge Report said the operation would take place on Friday in New York.\nJagger himself tweeted that he was \"devastated\" to delay the tour of 17 shows in the US and Canada that were due to start later this month and run until June.\n\"I will be working very hard to be back on stage as soon as I can,\" he added. \"I really hate letting you down like this.\"\nDoctors said that if the surgery goes well, Jagger could be back on his feet relatively rapidly.\nHeart surgeon and US television presenter Dr Mehmet Oz said \"about about 10 percent of people at his age have problem with their aortic valve which can lead to chest pain and dizziness.\n\"About 50 percent of people who have the problem will die in a couple of years if they don't have the surgery,\" he added in a video posted on Twitter.\nHe said traditionally the operation has been done with open heart surgery but \"new techniques allow us to do these procedures with minimal invasion with a catheter (tube). You can sneak your way up there and replace the old value with a new one.\n\"This allows the person to be back home in a day or two.

{"prefix": "Amid declining budgets and increasing priorities, Yale\u2019s library system has begun to deepen partnerships with peer institutions to address upcoming challenges.\nAs the University prepares for the arrival of 800 more students over the next four years, ensuring that students continue to have positive experiences at Yale\u2019s libraries is an immediate concern for University Librarian Susan Gibbons.\n\u201cWith the new colleges coming on line, we are going to need new staffing to support 800 additional students,\u201d Gibbons said, adding that more librarians will be needed to help with undergraduate outreach programs and in majors where students have senior theses. Gibbons also estimated that with the coming increase in the University\u2019s undergraduate student body, the library will need to spend an additional $1.2 million for electronic content licenses annually.\nThe challenges are exacerbated by the library\u2019s funding structure. According to Gibbons, about three-quarters of the libraries\u2019 budget comes from the return on over 600 library-specific endowments that are managed by the University Investments Office, with the rest coming from general appropriations provided by the Office of the Provost.\nSince the money coming from the endowment is designated for purposes that can be fairly narrow \u2014 such as a gift specifically for adding books written in shorthand or adding materials related to seafaring adventures \u2014 many of the library\u2019s new initiatives can only be funded by what amounts to a quarter of its budget, Gibbons said.\nAs a result of its reliance on returns from the endowment, the library is more susceptible to fluctuations in market performance than the University at large, whose overall spending from the endowment accounts for a third of its total annual revenue.\nConsequently, the library is especially hurt by cases of major disruptions such as the 2008 financial crisis. Data submitted to the Association of Research Libraries indicates that Yale\u2019s total annual library expenditure had decreased by over $10 million \u2014 nearly 15 percent of its total budget \u2014 between 2005 and 2015.\nGibbons also noted that between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2011, the general appropriations portion of the library\u2019s budget was reduced by about 30 percent. ARL statistics show a decrease in the library\u2019s staffing by nearly 100 members between 2009 and 2010.\nFor Gibbons and other librarians, collaboration nowadays has become a much more active process beyond the adoption of best practices at other libraries. In fact, librarians across different universities interviewed said collaboration is now an integral part of how research libraries operate today.\nHarvard University Librarian Sarah Thomas expressed a similar sentiment, noting that while the 2008 crisis has created challenges, the downturn motivated libraries to pursue innovative approaches to accessing and using information.\nLibrarians interviewed cited the significant expansion of the BorrowDirect service \u2014 an intercollegiate system that allows students from participating schools to borrow library resources from other institutions \u2014 as an example of the increase in collaboration among research libraries.\nThe idea of a service like BorrowDirect was first discussed in the early 1990s with support from senior librarians at Yale, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania, according to BorrowDirect\u2019s website. Since its initial launch in 1999, the service has expanded to encompass the entire Ivy League and four other institutions: MIT, Duke,", "gen_completion": " UC Davis and the University of Virginia. Since 2013, it has also been implemented at Yale as well.\nAccording to Thomas, the idea of the service \u2014 initially conceived as a resource for students for borrowing booklets and periodicals, but increasingly becoming a resource for faculty and for researchers \u2014 stems from the idea of the university itself as a hub for research.\nAccording to Thomas, the University of Pennsylvania began the initiative in its College of Education, where it has now become the University\u2019s sole resource for borrowing books, electronic content and other resources. The service now allows students to borrow materials ranging from textbooks, journal articles and lecture notes from nine libraries throughout five major universities.\n\u201cLibrary resources are important. But if I have to read three books at home to get done what I am working on at Harvard, that isn\u2019t going to work for me,\u201d Thomas stated. The service has led to an increase in the number of citations in research articles borrowed from the"}

{"prefix": "The distributors of powerful prescription opioids and the Drug Enforcement Administration failed to stop the flow of millions of pills into rural West Virginia despite rampant warning signs that the pills were being diverted for abuse, inertia that contributed to the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic, a congressional report has found.\nA report from the majority staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee found that distributors, which fulfill orders for prescription drugs to pharmacies, failed to conduct proper oversight of their customers by not questioning suspicious activity and not properly monitoring the quantity of painkillers that were being shipped to individual pharmacies.\nThe committee also found that the DEA did not properly use a database that aims to monitor the flow of powerful prescription painkillers from manufacturers to sellers, something that could have allowed federal agents \u2014 in real time \u2014 to notice that millions of pills were being sent to pharmacies in West Virginia. The agency also curtailed enforcement of distributors, the report found, and infighting inside the agency affected the way cases were handled.\nThe 324-page report, the culmination of an 18-month investigation of alleged pill dumping in West Virginia, shows how mistakes and lack of oversight led to a massive influx of pills there, much of which ultimately fueled the black market sale and illegal abuse of opioids, including oxycodone.\nThe Controlled Substances Act requires distributors and the DEA to diligently report and track data about such drugs, and the report found that neither did. West Virginia has been the epicenter of the opioid crisis; the state has the highest overdose death rate in the country.\nThe committee investigated the nation\u2019s three largest drug distributors: Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson Corp. The report said the companies combined sent more than 900 million doses of hydrocodone and oxycodone to West Virginia from 2005 to 2016. It also looked at two regional distributors: Miami-Luken and H.D. Smith. The report said those companies made \u201cinordinate shipments\u201d of opioids to pharmacies in the state during the same time frame.\nCardinal Health said in a statement that it commends the committee for \u201cexamining this complex national public health issue.\u201d The company said it will \u201ccontinue to implement rigorous anti-diversion controls\u201d and continue to raise awareness about the dangers of overprescribing painkillers.\nRichard H. Blake, outside counsel for Miami-Luken, declined to comment, saying he was reviewing the report ahead of its slated public release Wednesday.\nMcKesson did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.\nOn Wednesday, after the report was released, DEA spokesman Melvin Patterson said the agency has upgraded its software program so it can more proactively investigate suspicious opioid orders. He said the changes have led to an increase in investigations into, and prosecutions of, manufacturers, distributors and providers during the past three years.\nStarting in 2005, the DEA held one-on-one meetings with distributors to remind them of their legal obligation to prevent pills from being diverted to the black market, and the agency sent letters to all distributors in 2006 and 2007 to reiterate that obligation, according to the report.\nThose letters did not work, the report concluded. Cardinal Health was fined $34 million in 2008 to resolve allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders, and McKesson was fined a little more than $13 million.\nDespite paying the fines, the report alleges that the distributors continued to look the other way, allowing pills to flood into West Virginia. The report said that many of the distributors shipped pills to pharmacies with no regard for how many pills a store should need to have in stock based on the population it serves; during a two-week period in 2008, Cardinal increased what it sent to a pharmacy in Williamson, W.Va., more than 1,500 percent.\nThe report also said that distributors continued to pump pills into pharmacies even after", "gen_completion": " drug tests found that they violated the Controlled Substances Act by not reporting that their pills were being diverted for drug abuse.

This distortion, called gravitational wave memory, could allow us to detect waves previously beyond our reach \u2013 even if we can\u2019t see the event that caused them.\nThis offers hope that we may be able to find some of the universe\u2019s most exotic objects.\nGravitational waves are created by massive objects moving through space-time. In 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) first detected a gravitational wave caused by two black holes spiralling towards one another and merging. Since then, theorists have been hard at work figuring out what such waves from other events and objects would look like.\nSome of the most exotic objects in physics, such as evaporating black holes, cosmic strings and even possible extra dimensions, would induce gravitational waves at much higher frequencies than we can currently detect.\nBut there is still hope that these elusive objects could leave a detectable signal, say Lucy McNeill and her colleagues Eric Thrane and Paul Lasky at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.\nIf two people were floating near, say, a pair of merging black holes, the space between them would grow and shrink as space-time was stretched and distorted by gravitational waves.\nOnce the black holes merged and the waves ceased, this oscillation would stop \u2013 but the two people would be at a different distance apart to when they started. Memory of the gravitational waves would leave them slightly further apart or closer together.\nThis permanent distortion of space-time creates a signal 10 to 100 times weaker and with a frequency much lower than the original one from the oscillating gravitational wave.

The booklet sat at Ryan Davis' vendor table, and enough people bought his pitch \u2014 and the \"rough\" of his new comic \u2014 to fund a limited run of a full-color glossy version.\nIn June, at the 2012 Denver Comic Con, he made more than 100 sales, enough to publish the next issue.\nDavis is a 30-year-old with a dream: He wants to break into the big time in the comic book industry. He and his partner, Colorado Springs artist Gunther Goltz, have come up with what they hope will be a winning story that will catch the attention of big names.\n\"There are basically two ways of breaking into the business,\" says Steven Seagle, the Colorado Springs-bred co-founder of Man of Action Studios (creators of Cartoon Network's Ben 10), supervising producer for Disney XD's Ultimate Spider-man series, and veteran comic book writer for both DC and Marvel Comics. \"You can either produce your own comic, or you can know someone in the business.\n\"If you produce your own comic,\" he advises, \"do it from top to bottom. Find a way to get it out to the world. Self-publish it. This is your calling card.\"\nVelvet Garden is based on a 1980s urban legend about a psychoactive video game machine called Polybius, released by the U.S. government as an experiment in mind control. Davis and Goltz will officially unveil the second issue Saturday, Aug. 25, at Escape Velocity, the comics-and-graphic-novels store where they both work. But they've been selling and giving out samples for several weeks.\nWith Velvet Garden, they're actually debuting the three-volume, 18-issue series with Volume No. 2. Davis, who wrote the story, and Goltz, the illustrator, decided that it would showcase the story line better than the first volume, a prequel that goes into the game's background.\n\"In the first issue, the reader learns about Hitler's experiments with mind control, and some of the machines he built, but we didn't want readers to think the series was a World War II story, because it's not,\" Davis says. \"So, we went with the second volume, which takes place in the '80s.\"\nThe first (chronologically) of the three-volume set is called Wicked Garden, and the last, which is set in Colorado Springs, is titled Neon Garden. All three will eventually be made into distinct graphic novels, each made up of six serialized comic books.\nThough he's been in the business for a decade, Davis has worked with the single focus of breaking into the industry for about a year. That started with co-creating a publishing company called Ruby Carriage, through which he produced several Internet-based comics before this current endeavor.\nHaving a central location or imprint where people can find all his work makes things easier, but doesn't cover all the bases. Seagle says most comic fans still want something they can hold, and publishers want to see good-quality artwork.\n\"The quality has got to be great. It has to be the same as, say, your favorite comic, but in an original voice only you can provide...", "gen_completion": " It takes guts. But at the same time, being an artist, you want to make a living doing what you love. You have to be willing to take that leap.\"\nDavis is confident it will net him the sort of big break he's dreamed about all these years. He's already in touch with major cartoonist Ed McGuinness, and could be in touch with Ed's partner, writer James Robinson, soon.

Quebec fees are the lowest in the country, where average tuition at public post-secondary institutions is $5,366.\nTuition for an undergraduate arts student at the University of B.C. has quintupled over the past 30 years, rising from about $900 a year to approximately $4,600. At the same time, the minimum wage increased threefold, to $10.25 an hour this year from $3.65.\nB.C. fees have been climbing steadily since 2002, when the newly elected Liberals killed a six-year freeze introduced by the previous NDP government. Tuition soared as post-secondary schools tried to make up lost revenue \u2014 the University of B.C. boosted undergraduate fees by an average of 22 per cent, while the hike at Simon Fraser University and the University of Victoria was around 30 per cent.\nFaced with anger from students and parents, the Liberals announced a cap in 2005 that now holds annual increases to two per cent. Nevertheless, universities are drawing a greater percentage of their revenues from student fees while the portion covered by government funding has been shrinking steadily.\nIn recent years, discussions in B.C. have focused on student loan reforms.

{"prefix": "Born Wet, Human Babies Are 75 Percent Water. Then Comes The Drying : Krulwich Wonders... A fresh tomato is 93.5 percent water. A fresh baby girl or boy is 75 percent water. A banana, 74 percent. We all start wet, and then, inevitably, dry. A 1-year-old baby carries 10 percent less water; a male adult 15 percent less. Life is a slow evaporation, with some curious exceptions.\nLovely, no? Now think of this baby abstractly \u2014 as a sack of hundreds of millions of atoms. Here's the atomic formula for a new human being, arranged by elements, according to scientist Neil Shubin.\nNotice that the two most plentiful atoms are H (hydrogen) and O (oxygen) which shouldn't be a big surprise, since 2 H's and an O make water, and we humans are very moist, especially when we're born.\nIt turns out, a brand new human baby is 75 percent water.\nWe're born as wet as a fresh potato. Tomatoes are wetter (93.5 percent water). Apples, too, but only slightly (80 percent). Check out this fruit vs. baby comparison.\nOK, we aren't as wet as watermelons (who'd want to be?), but still, we begin our lives as noisy dewdrops that will one day learn to crawl, then walk. As science writer Loren Eiseley once put it, people \"are a way that water has of going about, beyond the reach of rivers.\"\nBut then, with every step we take, we begin to dry. The longer we live, the drier we get. One year after birth, a human baby is only 65 percent water \u2013 a ten percent drop, says the U.S. Geological Survey.\nBabies are wetter than children. By the time we're adults, the USGS says, adult men are about 60 percent water, adult women 55 percent. Elderly people are roughly half water.\nThere are variations, of course. The more buff you are (muscle tissue stores more water) the wetter you are. Because women generally have more fat cells, they tend to be a bit drier. Fat cells aren't as moist. The water that lubricates your joints, flushes your waste (I'm talking about pee), assists seminal reproduction, and absorbs shocks to your bones \u2014 as you age, the moisturizer in you slowly dwindles.\nAnd the odd thing is, our wet parts aren't where you'd think. I figured if some giant fist were to plunge out of the sky and squeeze a human like a sponge, the wettest bit would be our blood. That's wrong.\nOur brains, lungs, heart, liver and kidney contain the wettest tissue \u2014 between 65 and 85 percent water. Bones, of course, are", "gen_completion": " dry. The most sensitive, delicate parts \u2013 the retinas of our eyeballs, the nerves \u2013 use a lot of water. I can understand why.

The brain, of course, isn't affected by water as it does the bones and eyes \u2014 our brains are the driest parts of our bodies, because they need a lot of blood to work. Sigh.\nSo why the difference?\nPerhaps the most popular explanation that probably explains a lot of our weird bodily difference, says scientist Dr. John M. Hsu, Ph.D., a gerontologist at the University of Florida, is something we've called \"ageism.\" When we become humans, our hormones begin to make decisions that set us on track for becoming water. It's a little like our genes choose how the \"pre-baby\" version of our body turns out.\nThis is true for every single"}
{"prefix": "The Department of Education has issued new guidance for school districts on how to devise schoolwide plans for Title I money aimed at raising the achievement of disadvantaged students.\nThe long-awaited \u201cnonregulatory\u201d guidance is intended to help steer schools through federal legislation\u2014though the guidance itself is not binding\u2014as schools set up comprehensive Title I compensatory education programs reauthorized under the No Child Left Behind Act. The 4-year-old law is the latest version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\nThe guidance allows a school with at least 40 percent of its students determined to be low-income to operate a schoolwide program, as opposed to a targeted program. A targeted program seeks to identify and specifically serve low-income students.\nTo create a schoolwide program, a school must redesign its entire educational program to serve all students, the guidance says. The schoolwide idea has gained popularity as it reflects principles emphasized in the No Child Left Behind law, including accountability, research-based practices, and community engagement.\nThe guidance, issued late last month, says a school wanting to establish a schoolwide program must conduct a comprehensive assessment of the school\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and develop a plan that lays out ways to attract and keep highly qualified teachers, identify research-based strategies to raise achievement for all students, increase parental involvement, and coordinate federal, state, and local programs.\nThe guidance has long been anticipated.

A final version is still pending submission to the Department of Education Office of Inspector General, and the agency has not comment on it. Many of the provisions in the guidance reflect views advocated by educational conservatives, notably charter schools.\nThough the guidance focuses largely on providing more funding and flexibility to school districts, it does not say whether state officials have to hold separate state charters in order to administer Title I programs.

{"prefix": "Believe it or not, a household pulling in over $130,000 can still avoid the tax!\nThis may help ease your tax burden when it comes to capital gains.\nAs tax season winds itself to a close, many American families have had to fork over a pretty penny for selling investments. Of course, this doesn't necessarily apply to tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but there are still a lot of families that have side money invested in the stock market for non-retirement purposes.\nToday, I'm going to tell you how many -- most, actually -- American families could sell their stock investments for a gain and not owe Uncle Sam a penny.\nFor starters, you absolutely must own the stocks you are going to sell for at least a year. Once you get beyond 365 days, your investment is considered a \"long term\" one, and that opens it to a host of tax advantages. If you follow the buy-to-hold investment philosophy that we preach here at The Motley Fool, this shouldn't be too hard.\nNext, let's take a look at how those long-term capital gains are taxed by the federal government.\nSource: Author's illustration, with information provided by the IRS.\nIf your household falls under the 10% or 15% tax bracket, then you can sell your investments -- up until they bump you into a new tax bracket -- and pay absolutely no taxes whatsoever!\nWhat do those tax brackets look like? According to The Tax Foundation, this is what the upper limit of the 15% bracket will look like.\nBut aren't these the exceedingly poor households?\nThat's a fair question. On the surface, it would appear that only those who are poor would qualify for this break. Once you scratch the surface, however, a different picture appears.\nFor starters, here's the breakdown of the average American household, via data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nSo if we assume that the average household is a married couple, and we don't take any deductions whatsoever (which would never happen), the average American household could still sell stocks and net gains of over $8,000 ($75,300-$66,877) without ever having to turn over a dime for those gains.\nTo really get an idea of how possible this is, let's look at the extreme end of the spectrum: a family of four that earns $135,000 before taxes. This is the type of demographic that even naysayers would agree could probably be making such investments -- meaning they have enough money left over to invest.\nAgain, on the surface, it would seem absurd that this family could possibly avoid capital gains taxes. But let's take a look at four very simple deductions that the family", "gen_completion": " can take.\nNot all of these deductions are able to be used all at once, and so, depending on what deductions you're trying to use, these four could provide quite a bit of room for tax deductions:\n1) Social Security (SSI) -- this will help offset any capital gains taxes that the family may incur\n2) IRA distribution -- this will help offset capital gains taxes\n3) IRA distribution tax credits -- these will help offset capital gains taxes\n4) IRA distribution tax credit dollar limit -- these will help offset capital gains taxes if the household buys an additional $5,500 in qualifying assets (i.e. homes, stocks, and bonds).\n5) IRA distribution refunded tax credit -- tax credits will help offset capital gains taxes if the household buys an additional $3,500 in qualifying assets.\nAs you can see, by purchasing a home or a 401(k) before taxes, you could potentially save yourself hundreds of dollars in taxes if you"}
{"prefix": "Calling it a \"hidden epidemic,\" county health officials are lauding a new strategy by Gov. Andrew Cuomo to increase screening and treatment for the Hepatitis C virus.\nCuomo last week announced new strategies to eliminate Hep C, piggybacking on a previous effort to tackle HIV in New York. The new effort aims to stop the spread of the Hep C virus by increasing access to medications that can cure the disease and by expanding programs to connect New Yorkers in high-risk communities with wrap-around services for prevention, screening and treatment.\nDr. Gale Burstein, Erie County health commissioner, said many people don't realize Hep C has made a major comeback, and just how deadly it can be.\n\"The problem is, Hep C is the most deadly disease in the United States, causing more deaths than HIV. And because it causes permanent liver damage and cirrosis, it's also the No. 1 cause of liver cancer,\" she said. \"However, if it's diagnosed early, Hep C can be treated on an outpatient basis.\"\nBurstein also serves on Cuomo's AIDS Task Force, which has a goal of eliminating HIV/AIDS in New York by 2020.\nLast year, there were 573 confirmed cases of chronic and acute Hep C infection across New York. For Western New York, the state reported an infection rate of 89.9 per 100,000 population, compared to a statewide rate of 73.9 cases per 100,000.\nThe incidence of Hep C has been growing along with opioid addiction that leads to heroin use, especially among young people 20 to 40. Acute cases reported have risen by 75 precent, and over 80 percent of those were among young people. Half of cases were women, and nearly 86 percent of those infected reported a history of injection drug use. Worse, Burstein says, many of those women are of reproductive age.\n\"So we have to worry not only about infection among those women, but we have to worry about vertical transmission during pregnancy and how to manage those newborns,\" she said.\nGov. Cuomo's plan calls for increasing funding for Hep C prevention, testing and treatment programs, such as", "gen_completion": " the New York State Department of Health's (NYSDOH) Hepatitis C Prevention Network, which has reached over 1 million people so far and has treated 9,100 people. The plan also would allow people to obtain medication quickly and at low cost and to provide wraparound services to ease the stigma of the virus and help with testing and counseling that can lead to treatment.\n\"By providing people with more affordable access to treatments and by broadening treatment services, we are able to reduce the health care bills that are now a top concern for people with Hep C,\" Cuomo said in a written statement.\nBurstein said that means educating all the people living in high-risk communities or at risk of HIV, and working with religious, community and government organizations that already address those communities in the area. She said New Yorkers who test positive for Hep C face high stigma.\n\"People who test positive for Hep C face extreme emotional stress because they think that the disease is going to hurt"}

{"prefix": "Geographical Situation: The radar is located on Black Jack Mountain, about 8km WSW of Gunnedah, at nearly 700 metres above sea level. This gives the radar an excellent view in all directions. Based on detecting echoes at an altitude of 3,000 metres, the radar coverage extends north across Moree, northeast over Inverell and Guyra, east to Armidale, southeast to Scone and the Upper Hunter, south to Mudgee, southwest towards Dubbo and Gilgandra, west to Coonamble and northwest over Burren Junction.\nMeteorological Aspects: The radar should provide excellent coverage of the Namoi region, including Tamworth and the Liverpool Plains.

In particular, the Liverpool Ranges and Warrumbungles to the south and southwest of the radar obstruct the radar's view of low-level conditions beyond about 100km in these quadrants. This means that light showers and drizzle activity over the Upper Hunter and the Dubbo/Gilgandra regions may not be detected by the Namoi radar.

While he has had a number of top charting single releases, he has never been considered an artist who produces hit songs in the normal sense of the term.

Thus his Greatest Hits compilation released in February of 1995 felt a little suspicious.\nLet me say that if you want to explore Bruce Springsteen\u2019s music you need to start with his studio albums.

It is just a collection of songs that were created during his early period as a songwriter, which can range from the early 70s, through the early 80s when he would spend much of the time writing and producing his solo albums.

So says the judge.\nOn Thursday, Judge John Keenan of New York\u2019s Southern District dismissed the City of New York\u2019s lawsuit against the international oil and gas companies BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, and Royal Dutch Shell. Facing billions of dollars in climate change-related damage in the coming years, New York was hoping to extract some money from the transnational companies that extract the oil that people burn for energy\u2014raising the planet\u2019s temperature, exacerbating storms, melting polar ice and elevating sea levels, worsening wildfires, extending droughts, and allowing diseases to spread farther and faster.\nCities around the country have been filing lawsuits, hoping to get money from oil companies to pay for things like seawalls and infrastructure improvements\u2014part of a strategy that\u2019s been developing for decades. Oil companies have continued to market and lobby for lighter regulation on a product that made life harder on the only planet anyone knows about with life on it, while the US government moved slowly, if at all, toward remaking the country\u2019s energy production and carbon emissions. If regulation and the law won't help, the theory goes, you turn to the courts.\nIndeed. And beyond that, two previous cases offered precedents unfavorable to the plaintiffs. The cities argued that global warming was damaging them, specifically and locally (and in fact in California they tried to file in state court but got bumped to federal). But the courts disagreed, framing carbon emissions as a \"transboundary\" global issue, of international scope. And American Electric Power v.

ExxonMobil both found that the Clean Air Act \u201cdisplaced\u201d federal", "gen_completion": " jurisdiction and could not be used to bring lawsuits over climate change-induced pollution.\nThe ruling in Kivalina was more subtle. It noted the two states\u2019 and localities\u2019 claims of pollution from offshore drilling and pollution from pipelines (an area of the oil industry\u2019s legal expertise), but stopped short of explaining why those factors had all of the potential to elevate the locales\u2019 pollution risks. The judge explained that the state courts would have to unpack whether one climate-related factor, the development and transport of coastal oil and gas, was \u201csubstantially\u201d mitigating other potential factors. The decision is notable because it\u2019s at odds with the other cases. The oil industry was clearly fighting to keep the Clean Air Act as it was.

{"prefix": "What\u2019s been happening is NASCAR conducting more thorough inspections at its research and development center in North Carolina, and assessing midweek penalties for winners that failed. The sport had never stripped a driver of a win.\nKevin Harvick, for instance, won last fall at TMS, but his car failed inspection a couple days later. NASCAR handed a significant penalty, including losing an automatic berth into the championship finale, but he\u2019s still recognized as the race winner.\nThat won\u2019t be the case anymore, although it\u2019s far from perfect.\nNASCAR will conduct thorough post-race inspections at the track this season, a process that will take approximately 90 minutes, compared to sending the cars to North Carolina. However, in that 90-minute window, the Victory Lane celebration and post-race interviews will have already been conducted.\nIf a winning car fails inspections, the second-place team wins the race. By that point, though, the second-place team will be long gone from the track.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the downside -- you\u2019ve had a false celebration in Victory Lane,\u201d Gossage said. \u201cBut this falls squarely on the shoulders of the teams. They can not put themselves in any sort of position to be found breaking the rules. Before, it was embarrassing to fail inspection, but you kept the win.\nThe good news for Gossage is he\u2019s at least had experience with false celebrations.\nTMS\u2019 first open-wheel race in June 1997 crowned Billy Boat the initial race winner and Boat went through the Victory Lane celebrations. Upon protest, it was determined that the race winner was actually Arie Luyendyk.\nThe race is best remembered for Luyendyk and Boat\u2019s team owner, A.J. Foyt, getting into a scuffle on Victory Lane. But Gossage and TMS had to recreate a Victory Lane celebration with Luyendyk a couple years afterward for posterity\u2019s sake.\nGossage would like to avoid such instances going forward, but overall felt this is the right step for NASCAR to take. The sport is unique in terms of post-race inspections, and it should handle it in as timely a manner as possible.\nNASCAR is trying to liven up the truck series with what it\u2019s calling the \u201cTriple Truck Challenge.\u201d The series announced a new bonus program that will award a bonus check for the winning drivers at TMS (June 7), Iowa (June 15) and Gateway (June 22).\nEach race has a $50,000 bonus going to the winning driver. That amount goes higher if a driver wins multiple races -- winning two of the three nets a driver $150,000 total, and winning all three would net a total of $500,000.\n\u25aa TMS is having a Daytona 500 watch party later this month at the track, and Gossage said the track has received a record number of camping RSVPs for the event", "gen_completion": ".

The tour will conclude in Miami, where Elliott will race on stage at an event that will air on Fox Sports 1.\nGossage said NASCAR is trying to make it easier for fans who don\u2019t want to catch the race on TV each week in order to see his NASCAR Network and SiriusXM race studio shows throughout the season.\n\u201cThey recognize the need to be accessible and easy on the eyes of our fans,\u201d Gossage said. \u201cYou might not want to go through the whole day of the race,"}

With a longer press it also enables and disables the notification beep and/or vibration. A third button powers down the Bluetooth link, whether you need to conserve power or you\u2019re about to take a flight and need to switch off radio-spaffing gadgets.

So far there\u2019s only an iOS app, though an Android version is being considered, ConnecteDevice tells me. The app is clearly a work in progress: there\u2019s no notification for incoming email or text messages yet, for instance, which limits the Cookoo\u2019s utility somewhat, though ConnecteDevice is keen to talk to developers who want to support its gadget in their apps. With no alphanumeric display, you\u2019ll still have to check your phone to see who texted or called.\nAnd that\u2019s the Cookoo\u2019s fundamental flaw.

David Peat\u2019s Blackfoot Physics is the modern version of The Tao of Physics, with Blackfoot metaphysics as the more spiritually mature system against which Western physics is to be referred and compared. Like Fritjof Capra, Peat argues that during this century physicists have been discovering a picture of reality that has remarkable resonances with what other cultures have been saying for thousands of years.

While Capra used the parallels with Taoism to make physics more palatable, Peat uses his to plead for a more serious consideration of \u201cindigenous science\u201d. That is the heart of this book. It is not that Peat himself believes that Native American knowledge needs to be justified in Western terms, but rather, as he poignantly points out, that in the current intellectual climate it is difficult for indigenous people to get a serious hearing for their epistemological and metaphysical systems.\nA theoretical physicist and the author of a dozen previous books on subjects such as quantum reality and chaos, for the past decade Peat has immersed himself in the indigenous cultures of America and has been organising dialogues between Western scientists and Native American elders. He was reluctant to write this book at all, because indigenous knowledge is so embedded in land, language, and lived experience that it does not lend itself easily to written explication.\nFor the Blackfoot and their cousins, knowledge is not something to be rashly bandied about but is an active power whose careless invocation could have unwanted repercussions. But Peat was finally convinced to write because so many Native American youth are turning away from their culture. Knowing that their traditional knowledge has parallels with physics, he was told by a tribal elder, might help to revitalise their pride in their own heritage.\nThroughout", "gen_completion": " his career Peat has championed Indigenous knowledge as a gift from the Creator and a vital element in Western science.

But he points out that the Blackfoot have no reason to think Earth is just another planet, even less a manifestation of the higher powers that govern our universe.

Proof is actually a merger of Lone Wolf Riflestocks of Kalispell, Jense Fabrication of Missoula, ABS out of Lincoln, Neb., and Lawrence Rifle Barrels of Lewistown.\nAlthough only one of the core companies was from the Kalispell area, lead investor Mike Goguen said it made sense to locate Proof in the Flathead Valley.\nGoguen said he became involved in Proof while looking for a lightweight hunting rifle, and got more than he bargained for when his custom rifle was finished.\nIn addition to folding several manufacturers under the Proof umbrella, Goguen said the company still contracts out certain parts, such as trigger assembly and receivers, to local companies such as Defiance Machine.\nWith the four founding companies coming together to form Proof, the company needed a home in the Flathead. A new, state-of-the-art manufacturing, research and design facility was built on U.S. 2 between Kalispell and Columbia Falls. The grand opening was held Nov. 16.\nAlthough the company had been producing weapons and courting larger contracts for the two years since its founding, Rainey said the owners and investors were very careful about making sure the business was strong before opening its doors to the public.\nCurrently Proof employs 29 employees, and Rainey said the company still is hiring. Goguen said there is great potential for job growth.\n\u201cIt's a slow, measured growth that we're aiming for; we've got a tight budget and we have faced challenges every single day, but we're overcoming them,\u201d Rainey said.\nThe barrels Proof manufactures are not completely made of carbon fiber, rather they are traditional steel cores, machined down and wrapped with carbon fibers. According to Rainey, this results in a lighter-weight, more effective barrel of the same or similar overall dimensions and strength as more traditional all-steel barrels.\nAlthough the technology for carbon-fiber barrels may have been around for the last 20 years, the big problem to overcome was failure due to heat.\nIn a typical rifle, the heat of extended firing will cause the barrel to warp slightly, and this can lead to a \u201cfairly large\u201d dispersion pattern. This means that what started out as shots in a dime-sized grouping on a target can expand to shots that could completely miss the point of aim. In some weapons, like the fully automatic M249 squad automatic weapon used by the military, the heat is so detrimental that multiple barrels are carried to prevent jams and increase accuracy.\nWhen carbon-fiber barrels first came on the scene, the heat dispersion was not much better than that of a standard steel barrel, and it wasn't until recently that the problem was solved by Advanced Barrel Systems.\n\u201cHeat causes failure, and failure causes death, and we want to prevent that,\u201d Goguen said.\nMany of the weapons Proof produces are for military and peacekeeping operations where accuracy matters most.\nThe other big benefit to carbon-fiber barrels and stocks is a significant weight reduction.\nRainey said that weight reduction can be very significant, whether it is for a soldier in the field or a hunter out for the weekend.", "gen_completion": "\nAside from the cost reduction of the lighter weight barrel, Rainey emphasized the lower cost associated with these barrels over the steel barrel types. Steel barrels are more expensive by at least 10 percent for military rifles, and Steel Plus Arms Co. of Jackson, Montana, estimates that steel composite barrels will save the military around $20 million a year on ammunition alone.\nOver at Proof Research, the average price of the barrel is about $15, which means clients from across the West have been looking for ways to keep those savings from added to the cost of the gun. The price of the carbon-fiber barrel is slightly higher at $20, but it will save the customer around $2,000 when using the same rifle type.\n\u201cIf it's a lot to pay for the additional cost, that's up to the customer to make sure it's worth it.

We asked people to send in a picture of their mother and explain what made their relationship special. Thousands of people entered for a chance to win flights on a route our client was keen to promote. As a result, we were left with thousands of images of happy customers, which we could then use in marketing material for the airline.\nBut be aware: you need to obtain permission to use any images, even if they have been sent to you.\nThe psychological phenomenon of \u201csocial proof\u201d, which says that people are drawn to a product or service that they know others are already engaging with, is a pivotal part of marketing. So appointing brand ambassadors, people who genuinely like your brand, is a great way to spread your message.\nAbout Balance, a health and wellbeing centre in Brighton, got in touch with a local writer and offered them a week of free therapies in exchange for them becoming their \u201cwellbeing ambassador\u201d and writing about their experience in local publications. This is becoming more of a trend among small businesses who are engaging with bloggers, offering them a taste of their product or service in exchange for a review.\nClearly there are no guarantees that a review will be positive. However, if a blogger writes a negative review, you should acknowledge this and respond in the comments. Also, contact the blogger personally to try to resolve or understand what could have been done differently. Although negative reviews aren\u2019t the ideal result, more often than not it\u2019s how the business responds", "gen_completion": " to them that makes the difference.\nUltimately this is a win-win.

As someone who started in international trade, I more than anyone should have known that specific factors, not Stolper-Samuelson, is usually the way to go.\nFor the 99.9 percent of readers who have no idea what I\u2019m talking about: One of the landmark papers in international trade theory was the demonstration by Wolfgang Stolper and Paul Samuelson, way back in 1941, that the income distribution effects of protectionism typically swamp any efficiency considerations. If you said something judicious along the lines of \u201cWell, protectionism might increase labor\u2019s share, but workers will still end up losing because the economy will become less efficiency\u201d, you were just wrong in terms of the standard model: if an economy imports labor-intensive goods, protectionism will raise real wages \u2014 end of story.\nSo trade policy should have big effects on the distribution of income between broad classes of players \u2014 labor versus capital, highly educated versus less-educated labor, and so on. But if you try to understand the political economy of trade policy, what you see is much narrower interests at play \u2014 not capital in general but the owners of textile factories or sugar plantations. Blessed are the cheesemakers, not any manufacturers of dairy products. And the right model to think about this is the specific factors model of trade, in which capital is temporarily stuck in a particular industry; in the long run it may be fungible, but lobbyists don\u2019t worry about that.\nSo we\u2019ve had a long discussion of the distributional effects of QE and all that, which are ambiguous but also, I now realize, irrelevant.

It is not bad in principle for anyone to make economic decisions that have good distribution implications \u2014 the effect of capital on income distribution is irrelevant to that point.

If you think that the current regime in the United States should be raised to keep the level of the purchasing power of the dollar at a point where it might be of more utility, but you know that the Federal Reserve\u2019s real mandate is to keep short-term interest rates artificially low, that is what you are trying to explain.

When you&apos;ve shifted more than two million cars in the UK alone since 1980 it would seem folly to opt for anything else.\nFrom this weekend, the fifth generation of the Ellesmere Port-built car hits the road, and few other than Vauxhall aficionados are likely to recognise this latest Astra from its predecessor.\nNot to put too fine a point on it, this is a critically important launch for Vauxhall. The latest Astra enters an arena which accounts for 22 per cent of the entire west European car market.\nFrom day one of the design process Vauxhall made it a priority to put some real emotion into the Astra&apos;s final look.\nWith the Meriva and Zafira models catering for more practical demands, Vauxhall felt confident they could go for something really entertaining.\nGM Europe&apos;s design chief Martin Smith - the man responsible for the original Audi quattro - oversaw the operation, the result of which is a vehicle that bears little resemblance to its rather bland forerunner.\nInstead we have a car that throbs pulsatingly - from the exterior styling with its imposing grille, futuristic 3D headlamps and athletic silhouette, to the driving dynamics themselves.\nFans of the Astra won&apos;t be disappointed with the new car&apos;s cabin. There&apos;s a genuine feel of quality throughout with a simply laid out dash, classy looking grey centre console and sculpted shapes.\nRear space is premium class, too, with even the centre passenger able to achieve relative comfort rather than being &apos;perched&apos; awkwardly.\nIn fact, design-wise the only negative concerns the boot which, while boasting a fair capacity, has a narrow opening due to the car&apos;s sharp rear end. That could cause problems when loading large or bulky items.\nFirst to hit the roads is the five-door hatchback, built on Merseyside, where the three-door version - due next spring - may also be constructed. Autumn will see the arrival of a German-sourced estate model with an extended wheelbase.\nFour petrol and two diesel engines are offered at the outset and range from the entry-level 90bhp 1.4-litre, via 1.6, 1.8 and two-litre turbo petrol versions to a pair of 80 and 100bhp 1.7-litre diesels. A 1.9 CDTI unit with 150bhp is due from late summer.\nOf course the crunch for fleet and private buyers will be how the Astra performs on the road.\nPutting three of the six models - 1.6 and 2.0 Turbo petrol models along with a 100bhp 1.7 diesel - to the test on a series of demanding Lakeland routes convinced me that this range fulfils its manufacturer&apos;s boasts.\nIn each case the auto-adjusting steering was nicely balanced, engines quiet, power delivery at least useful and handling taut with terrific body control.

{"prefix": "A ban addressing the controversial practice of gay conversion therapy has passed through its first House committee.\nMedical students James Pathoulas and Kevin O'Donnell pose for a portrait on Feb. 22 on campus. The two are part of an effort to ban conversion therapy in Minnesota.\nThe proposed legislation written by Rep. Hunter Cantrell, DFL-Savage, passed through the Health and Human Services Policy Committee earlier this month. It requires licensed counselors and therapists to outline that conversion therapy is deemed ineffective by major medical organizations. The ban does not apply to pastoral counseling.\nNearly all major medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and American Psychological Association, have denounced conversion therapy, stating it is not grounded in scientific reasoning and can be detrimental to patients.\nCiting the important intersection of medicine and policy, University of Minnesota Medical School students James Pathoulas and Kevin O'Donnell voiced support for the ban.\n\u201cThis bill is really about protecting people, especially vulnerable people from a fraudulent practice,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\nPathoulas said exact statistics about the use of conversion therapy in Minnesota are unavailable because of \u201ccoded language,\u201d such as \u201crestorative therapy\u201d or \u201creligious counseling.\" A 2018 University of California-Los Angeles' Williams Institute study estimated 689,000 LGBTQ adults have received conversion therapy nationally, and an estimated 57,000 LGBTQ individuals will receive conversion therapy before the age of 18.\nOne of the most adamant supporters of this legislation has been OutFront Minnesota, an LGBTQ advocacy organization. Emma McBride, who works in policy and legislative affairs with the organization, said the bill does not infringe on religious freedoms.\n\u201cThe second part of the bill actually says you can\u2019t falsely advertise goods or services. We already have that law written for a good reason \u2014 to protect consumers and vulnerable Minnesotans \u2014 and we\u2019re just saying that that needs to apply to conversion therapy as well,\u201d McBride said.\nThe bill\u2019s critics say otherwise. Conservative and religious advocacy organizations, like Transform Minnesota and the Minnesota Family Council, say the bill infringes on religious freedoms.\nBratrud said abusive tactics once associated with conversion therapy are no longer used. In addition, Minnesota lacks data about the prevalence of conversion therapy necessary to back the ban.\nMcBride disagrees", "gen_completion": ".\n\u201cThese professionals often just ask if someone has thought out their decision and they can\u2019t help trying to lead the person through that conversation, that they need to make sure that whatever they\u2019re doing is helping,\u201d McBride said.\n\"We're ready to move it forward once we know how it's actually going to be implemented because making sure that those who are being targeted, people have somewhere else to go if this bill does come to fruition,\" O'Donnel said.\nRoughly 30 states have already banned conversion therapy. The Minnesota bill has been heard by the Health and Human Services Committee, but it has yet to be scheduled for a full vote, Bratrud said.\n\u201cWe think that the language that the House committee passed, really, does contain language that would prohibit these practices,\u201d Bratrud said.\nBratrud said she hopes the bill passes, adding that the state should join others"}
{"prefix": "Electing Democratic state legislator would bring substantial leadership shift that could benefit all South Dakotans.\nWhen Kristi Noem earned 57 percent of the vote in a surprisingly decisive Republican primary win over Marty Jackley in June, many political observers were ready to hand her the keys to the governor\u2019s mansion.\nThat\u2019s typically how it works in South Dakota, where the Grand Old Party reigns supreme and Democrats infamously haven\u2019t won a race for governor since 1974.\nIn some ways, this permanence of one-party rule has hindered progress. Ethical lapses and shrinking accountability allowed the Gear Up and EB-5 scandals to fester, while legislative crusades on social issues \u2013 transgender policy, immigration restrictions, abortion rights \u2013 have placed South Dakota far right of national norms.\nOne could argue that\u2019s fair game for an electorate that chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton by 30 points. But for a state that has seen Democratic figures such as George McGovern, Jim Abourezk, Tom Daschle, Tim Johnson and Stephanie Herseth make an impact in Washington, a multiplicity of interests within the state is hard to find.\nMuch of the blame lies with the South Dakota Democratic Party, which has failed to put forth candidates with the qualifications or political breadth to attract voters from outside their affiliation. In that respect, Billie Sutton came around at just the right time.\nThe four-term state senator from Burke doesn\u2019t represent a shock to the system for voters. He\u2019s a pro-life Democrat who supports gun rights and pledges fiscal conservatism rather than tax and spend.\nHis ranching and rodeo background give him insight into the fabric of South Dakota beyond fast-developing Sioux Falls, and his personal triumph over adversity strengthens his political resolve.\nWhen we endorsed Noem in the GOP primary, we pointed to the fact that she could make history as the state\u2019s first female governor and bring much-needed change to Pierre.\nBut Sutton represents a substantial leadership shift that could benefit all South Dakotans, not just those who fit a certain ideology. For voters who approved Initiated Measure 22 in 2016 to deal with corruption, only to see it torn asunder by Republican legislators, his plans for greater oversight ring true.\nOn top of advocating for stronger ethics legislation as minority leader, Sutton has campaigned for governor on enforcing stricter lobbyist limits, protecting whistleblowers, forming an ethics commission and reining in campaign finance.\nFor her part, Noem has also pledged to clean up Pierre. But a Republican chief executive in a heavily Republican state has less incentive to do so.\nThe four-term U.S. House member is more conservative than outgoing governor Dennis Daugaard on most social issues, which means no veto on potentially discriminatory legislation and no check on South Dakota criminalizing abortion if the Supreme Court throws the issue back to the states.\nIt\u2019s debatable whether voters see Noem\u2019s experience in Washington as a positive, considering that Congress has a national approval rating of 21 percent. She was a key player in pushing through federal tax reform that has contributed to a $779 billion deficit, making it too unpopular for most GOP candidates to tout on the campaign trail.\nThe Congresswoman also failed to score points by tar", "gen_completion": "ring the billionaire Koch brothers as conservatives in a state President Trump easily carried and was in the process of winning well before his candidacy was derailed.\nIn short, Noem has positioned South Dakota as a swing state. But instead of working with national and state politicians to make it better, she\u2019ll just be part one of an increasingly Republican establishment that already dominates the state.\nSutton isn\u2019t the only South Dakotan looking for a better future. He was part of the GOP\u2019s successful effort to defeat the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion last year, which allowed 800,000 South Dakotans to join the state health care program. He\u2019ll likely be a part of the same effort as it fights an expansion ballot initiative.\nSutton has made it clear he\u2019ll use those victories as a base for winning a seat in the U.S. Senate. It\u2019s a daunting task, especially in a state as Republican as South"}

She then went on to serve in the Israel Defense Forces as a physical trainer, where she whipped IDF soldiers into shape.\nWhile Refaeli was exempt from the draft because she was married at the time she would have been compelled to serve (Israel exempts married women from the armed services), Gadot served her two-year mandatory service.\nGadot has not been shy about her support of the IDF.

She'd make a great addition to the increasingly diverse Marvel Cinematic Universe too.\nEvangeline Lilly will portray The Wasp next up in \"Ant-Man & The Wasp,\" but the character has plenty of comic book history separate from Ant-Man to make up at least a few solo adventures.\nThe second Miss America in the comics would be Marvel's first Latina and LGBTQ superhero onscreen. Her own standalone comic launched this past March.\nDafne Keen's turn as the young mutant Laura -- AKA X-23 -- was a standout of Fox's late winter hit \"Logan,\" and could easily headline her own film. The idea even got support from \"Logan\" director James Mangold. \"I thought she was just such a great character, but with what Dafne did, I think that certainly that's possible,\" said Mangold.\nZatanna would be DC's answer to Marvel's \"Doctor Strange\" -- she's both a stage magician and a real sorceress.

How will businesses and portfolios fare with the 4 degrees of warming we are forecast to face this century, if business as usual continues?\nClimate change has given rise to a range of physical risks that can impact in the here and now.

The majority of that risk relates directly to physical impacts - we estimate that $777 billion of ASX200 market cap is exposed (as at 22 Jan 2019).\nMany of these risks may be laying dormant within company value chains. Many sectors rely on infrastructure that may be damaged by storms or floods or interrupted by heat stress, with the potential for operations to be halted for weeks - whether it be due to a downed data centre or freight, such as the Pacific National train that was tipped over into the water.\nOther businesses, including transport and packaging companies, serve the agriculture sector which is already becoming increasingly volatile.

{"prefix": "While the political ramifications of dependence on Russian natural gas are a current topic of debate within the European Union, often the talk fails to address a much larger issue of whether or not the importing of Russia\u2019s natural gas will help to meet the EU\u2019s growing demands.\nSo argues physicist Bengt S\u00f6derbergh, who recently completed a dissertation on an assessment of future Norwegian and Russian gas export levels.\nAccording to forecasts by the International Energy Agency (IEA), production of natural gas within the EU will decline from the 2006 level of 216 billion cubic metres per year (Gm3/year) to 90 Gm3/year by 2030, even as demand for gas is expected to rise significantly. The need to import gas will accordingly increase by up to 90 per cent during the period. Russia and Norway are currently the most significant suppliers of gas to the EU. Their combined share of the EU\u2019s gas imports during 2006 was 62 per cent.\nAs part of S\u00f6derbergh\u2019s analysis with regard to the future levels of Norwegian and Russian gas exports to the EU, Norwegian and Russian gas production scenarios were developed based on modelling of production from individual gas fields. As a result, the combined production from the largest fields \u2013 the so-called \u201cgiant fields\u201d \u2013 was forecast.\nEU energy security is significantly dependent on production from a relatively small number of Norwegian and Russian fields. Almost all of Norway\u2019s production derives from 18 large fields, 9 of which are classifiable as giant fields.\nEssentially all of Russia\u2019s production derives from 36 giant fields.\nThe findings show that there is little potential for an increase in the level of Norwegian gas exports to the EU. All of the scenarios studied indicate that Norwegian gas production will be in decline by 2030, by which year Norwegian gas deliveries to the EU via pipeline may have fallen by as much as 20 per cent from today\u2019s level.\nAdditionally, a study of potential production from Russian giant fields indicates a maximum increase of 45 per cent in the level of Russian gas exports to the EU by 2030.

A major new contribution from the Russian giant fields over the next decade would provide sufficient gas for at least 50 per cent of the EU\u2019s energy needs.\nBased on the most extensive forecast of Norwegian and Russian gas exports made available to date, these analyses clearly highlight that the EU has little direct energy leverage over Russian resources and will ultimately need to rely on substantial imports of Russian gas in order to meet its growing demand and keep its lights on.\nSource: Statens Serum Institut \u2013 S\u00f6derbergh Bengt, A/K/A Bengt S\u00f6derbergh. 2012, Norway, p. 22.\nhttp://docs.mathworks.com/content/92/3/527.abstract\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2020.

{"prefix": "\u201813 Hours\u2019 Review: Michael Bay\u2019s Benghazi Thriller Resonates, But Is It A Political Football?\n13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers Of Benghazi rates perhaps as director Michael Bay\u2019s most accomplished film to date, a timely and pulse-pounding true story of the terrorist attack on an American diplomatic outpost and a CIA Annex in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012. Paramount is releasing the film in the exact same corridor that brought success in the last couple of years to two other, somewhat similar movies American Sniper and Lone Survivor, and like the latter film in particular, Bay has crafted a patriotic, riveting war movie full of intense action that also thankfully puts a human face on exactly what happened in Benghazi.\nretired Navy Seals and Marines now in their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, is basically a movie that puts its emphasis on the brave men who fought this battle rather than the ensuing political storm it is still causing as we enter this Presidential election year. Hillary Clinton and President Obama (not even mentioned) are not the focus here as in the political debate about what was done \u2013 or not done- in this incident. Rather, it is these six men who form a unit called Group Global Response or GGR there, to protect and provide security for whatever problems might come up. When U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens (Matt Letscher) goes out to visit the vulnerable outpost, a terrorist attack soon follows and he is killed, a victim of smoke inhalation, along with three others. With no American military in sight, the GGR tries to ride to the rescue but are thwarted by a superior named Bob ( David Costabile) and lose crucial time. Against his orders they go anyway. When they get there the place is in flames and the CIA Annex is likely the next target. What ensues is a very violent war film full of shooting and explosions, exactly the kind of thing we have come to expect from Bay films, but here in the context of a true story seems all too real, putting the audience right in the center of the action.\nIn many ways this movie, which really only wants to focus on the warrior, not the war, is like many others, but because it is likely to be used as a political football (and already has been on Fox News) the real point of it could be sadly lost. I hope it isn\u2019t because seeing this whole thing from the POV of the men who were on the front lines, much like The Alamo in some ways (there\u2019s even a reference to that), is compelling moviemaking and a real step forward into something a little more important than another Transformers movie for Bay.\nThe acting across the board is excellent with standouts being John Krasinski as a former Navy Seal who must abandon his family just one more time to take on an assignment he thought would be brief and uneventful. Also memorable is", "gen_completion": " Oscar winner and fellow actor Ben Affleck who plays not only Stevens/Spartacus (and lover of his wife) but also the President of the Global Response, and another American Ambassador Jack Ryan (Christopher Plummer).

He can\u2019t even bring himself to watch the TV and calls the Ambassador by a moniker akin in tone to the Commander in Chief he can\u2019t stand. A very, very strange character indeed.

Obama must ask himself, \"What would Hugo Chavez do?\"\nObama decided to embark on a personal rehabilitation tour. He first stopped by the annual awards dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus and told blacks to \"stop complainin'. Stop grumblin'. Stop cryin'.\"\nDon't they realize that it's the Republicans' fault that black unemployment is nearly double the national average, at 16.7 percent? \"So many people in (Washington) are fighting us every step of the way.\"\nInstead of berating them, Obama ought to count his lucky stars that he's not taking more grief. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver said that if Bill Clinton were in the White House and didn't address the problem of black unemployment, blacks \"probably would be marching on the White House.\"\nObama's malcontent leftist friends on the Leftist Coast agree that he has not been liberal enough. So to regain their favor, he jetted out West in that covered wagon known as Air Force One and pleaded with them to understand the predicament he is in with nasty Republicans opposing him every step of the way. He is, he assured them, as radical as they are.\nIn Seattle, representing the downtrodden, Obama told the 65 guests who were paying a paltry $35,800 per couple, \"From the moment I took office, what we've seen is a constant ideological push-back against any kind of sensible reforms that would make our economy work better and give people more opportunity.\"\nThe bipartisan Obama told his fellow warriors for the poor that the Republican alternative \"is an approach to government that will fundamentally cripple America in meeting the challenges of the 21st century.\"\nThat's the ticket.

If we demand fiscal responsibility, we simply cannot be trusted to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\nObama's bird-brained policies are so exasperatingly ridiculous he's lucky no one is invoking the 25th Amendment to challenge his mental capacity to serve.\nThough it would never happen, it's time for Obama to go further and really tell the whole truth. Even if he believes, against all evidence and reason, that the government can improve the economy by sucking all remaining oxygen out of the private sector, that's not the only reason he is pushing for another reckless stimulus package.\nObama doesn't care about infrastructure or improving the disastrous unemployment numbers he's fueling. These are not what float his Marxist boat. Stimulus Jr. isn't about creating more economic demand, which it wouldn't do anyway. Like Stimulus Sr., it's about pressing forward with his nefarious scheme to restructure America in his image.\nIt would be bad enough if these boondoggles were just grab bags of political payoffs, money laundering, redistribution, and colossal waste. But they're also designed to create more government programs that will self-perpetuate.\nThrough Stimulus Jr., Obama would create a massive new bureaucracy to administer the nightmare \u2014 a bureaucracy that would not wither away when the program is completed, any more than Marx's government would wither away after the \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\"\nWhy is it so hard for some people to grasp that neither government tax and regulatory roadblocks against economic growth nor massive wealth redistribution programs improve the plight of lower- and middle-income groups?\nWhen will a greater percentage of blacks realize that liberal prescriptions harm rather than improve their economic conditions?

Meet the smart bottle.\nYes, one of our most interesting new technologies is going to ensure that we can drink a bottle of scotch with the utmost confidence that it\u2019s authentic. It will also give the scotch maker a way to engage more deeply with a consumer who might otherwise just toss that bottle away and never be heard from again. The smart bottle is part of the Internet of Things (IoT), or everyday objects that are connected to the Internet and have electronic brains.\nThinfilm Electronics is revealing its smart bottle in a deal with Diageo, the maker of the Johnnie Walker Blue Label brand of scotch. The smart bottle can verify for you that your 12-year-old bottle of scotch has never been opened before, and it can also connect via near-field communications to your smartphone.\nWith a smartphone app, you can learn some new things about your Johnnie Walker Blue Label, get personalized promotions, and communicate with the liquor company.\nThinfilm, based in Oslo, Norway, is showing off the smart bottle and the printed electronics that it developed for the bottle at the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona, Spain. The company recently announced a deal with Xerox that will enable Thinfilm to print billions of chips per year on tiny labels as part of its plan to track IoT devices.\nThinfilm has figured out how to print chips such as sensors on tags that can be attached to bottles. Using Thinfilm\u2019s OpenSense technology, a smart bottle can detect both the sealed and open state of the bottle. The tags and sensor information they contain will allow Diageo to send personalized communications to consumers who read the tags with their smartphones.\nThe project came from Diageo Technology Ventures, an experimental tech and investment arm of Diageo. The goal is to enable Diageo to send consumers targeted and timely marketing messages, whether at retail or after purchase. It can, for instance, send you cocktail recipes after you open the bottle.\nThinfilm\u2019s NFC-based tags can be read by readers all across the supply chain, allowing retailers and manufacturers to track inventory to the point of purchase. The tech provides a new layer of security in ensuring the authenticity of the scotch. Sutija said the tag adds tens of cents to the cost of a bottle.\nThinfilm said these NFC tags compete with conventional static QR codes that are often difficult to read, easy to copy, and do not support sensor integration.

The police chief of this St. Louis suburb said Wednesday that Brown injured the officer who later fatally shot the unarmed 18 year old though witnesses dispute that such an altercation occurred.\nAfter delivering remarks last night from the White House, President Obama fielded some questions from reporters and made a comment that stood out for me. \u201c[T]he vast majority of the community [in Ferguson] has been working very hard to try to make sure that this becomes an opportunity for us to seize the moment and turn this into a positive situation,\u201d he said.\nIt sounded like a nice-but-unrealistic goal. Years of systemic problems contributed to these crisis conditions, and the idea of turning the Michael Brown tragedy into something constructive is hard to fathom.\nThat said, over the summer, there was a fair amount of interest in one specific area: the militarization of local law enforcement.

Sure, they could switch to Starbucks or Coke, but who wants to support huge corporate brands when they could support slightly less huge brands owned by huge corporate brands?\nThat's why I'm gifting the world with my five ways to save Energy Drinks.\nYou know that feeling you get when you lick a 9-volt battery?

Instead of your traditional energy drink that comes in one can, these new energy drinks will come in two cans: One includes a deadly poison, the other contains the antidote. Simply drink down the first can and hand the second to a friend, bartender or licensed Energy Drink Warden with instructions not to give you the second until you have successfully danced for three hours straight or gotten showered and dressed for work.\nMakers of energy drinks claim \u2013 or rather imply in a carefully worded and legally acceptable manner \u2013 that their concoctions can improve brain function. While hard science refutes that, there are certainly ways to improve the brain while drinking energy drinks. For instance, require consumers to complete a moderately difficult Sudoku before they can buy one, or make it so you can only open it if you remember the capital of Bulgaria. Now the drink really does make you smarter!\nGiven that we've already accepted \"energy\" as a synonym for \"the jitters,\" maybe the solution is just to switch out vague unsupported claims that sound good with vague, completely true claims that sound good. For instance, try the slogan \"Red Bull Facilitates Your Krebs Cycle,\" or \"Amp: Contains What Will Eventually Become ATP.\" If you've ever given Kool-Aid to a college freshman and told him it was spiked with Everclear, you know that beverages often do what the drinker thinks it will do, and also that college freshmen are an endless source of amusement.

Because while you may not be able to make your energy drink \"work with\" it, you could make it \"work better\" with it. More specifically, I could probably tell them not to sell any drink named \"Powerade Zero\" and the label on the can would clearly state \"Powerade Boost\" instead and thus suggest, \"Powerade Boost + 10% Powerade Boost.\" (Even if I don't want to, of course.)

{"prefix": "As former sellers on Latin American\u2019s largest e-commerce site, the cousins had found it difficult to build clientele for their electronics-resale business. The two had become the second-biggest seller on the website Mercado Libre but still felt the site limited their company\u2019s potential.\n\u201cYou were not able to upload a photo or have a brand, so your customers are not able to find you again easily after they made a purchase,\u201d said Gomez in an interview at the company\u2019s office at the Miami Entrepreneurship Center.\nGomez, 27, also found that there was not much security against fraud for customers and sellers. The site did not protect buyers, which made them wary of purchases.\nWhile a safe and seamless online shopping experience is the standard in the U.S., they say this is not the case in Latin America.\nSo in November 2013, the pair came up with the idea to create an e-commerce site with more discovery infrastructure for business across Latin America.\nGomez received both his bachelor\u2019s degree and MBA from Florida International University, and Arellano has a business degree from a Venezuelan university. Using their business experience, the cousins launched Wuelto.\nWuelto, which went live in February, allows businesses to build an online brand through customizing their profiles.\n\u201cYou can have a profile so you can start creating a connection with your customers,\u201d Gomez said.\nAs buyers browse, icons indicate to them which country the product is from. They can use search filters to find sellers domestically or in a specific country.\nWuelto counts major businesses, such as Amazon and Best Buy, as affiliates, and smaller businesses benefit from the traffic brought in by these large retailers. Although these businesses draw in more traffic, they do not have more exposure than the site\u2019s small businesses.\n\u201cIt is good for young entrepreneurs because they can compete at the same level as Amazon,\u201d Gomez said.\nAffiliates are different though in that the purchasing process is redirected to their sites, where as the checkout process is on Wuelto for other sellers. Those sellers are charged a 10 percent commission fee and affiliates pay a referal fee of 6-15 percent. Gomez says they have generated a few thousand dollars in revenue so far.\nAnother unique component of the site is the social-network feature, which allows users to follow stores and their friends.\n\u201cWhen you are browsing for products you will see that the feed is based on the stores and the people you follow who have styles like you,\u201d Gomez said.\nUsers can also view their friends\u2019 wish lists to find gifts for them.\nAccess to Wuelto is also available through an app.\nAnd all of the businesses go through a", "gen_completion": " review process, which not all sellers use. The cousin team has been reviewing most of the business applications in Latin America, which has helped to determine if they would be of interest to entrepreneurs.\nWhile Wuelto sells most of the items sold on Amazon.com, the company has begun to grow beyond just selling to its new customer base.\nThe duo also plans to sell clothing, shoes, hair-care products and other accessories to sell to its audience and attract buyers from the local market.\nThough the Wuelto\u2019s partnership with Miami International Entrepreneurship Center is just as integral to their product launch, Gomez says it has been more difficult to make it out of the first three months. He says it took them about six months to establish a database for the business website.

{"prefix": "Hi, I'm Rich Brown, senior editor for cnet.com. Today, we're gonna take a look at the editor's choice winning Mad Catz Cyborg R.A.T. 9. So, this right here is one of the most expensive gaming mice we've ever seen. It comes in at a 150 dollars. So, it's definitely for the more committed PC gamers out there. That's it. This is also one of the most customizable mice we've ever seen and it's also a great performer. We recommend it to anybody looking to spend a lot of money on an input device for game. So, the RAT 9 comes with a lot of features we expect on a high end gaming mice these. That's a 5600 dpi laser sensor. That means it's very fast, very accurate. This is a wireless mouse, but Mad Catz does sell wired version for a little less. Now, this button right here lets you move through various dpi settings you can make the most more less sensitive as you're playing. You can also use the included driver's software to customize the settings, so you can really tweak and feel the mouse to exactly how you would like it, if you flip it over, you can see it done. At middle here, there is a series of weights that come upon this post. You can actually unscrew. There's cuff here to take the weights off and set the weight of the mouse you want it. That's actually a nice little feature and it really helps improve the overall feel of the mouse. The top of the posts are actually doubled as an Allen wrench with slots to adjust various points in the mouse to really make it feel good in your hand. Now, the thumb side of the mouse, you can use the Allen wrench to move this piece here, either up and down or you can loosen it so that it comes out an angle. That gives you a better position for your thumb potentially and the 2 side buttons as well as red button here as the red button is actually we haven't seen before. The idea is that when you are playing a shooting game and you have a sniper rifle, so you wanna run around really quick, you get have the position, you wanna have the nice fast cursor control so you can see you can see where you're going, but then when you zoom in on some somebody, you might want a little bit better control. So, when you push that button, you lowers that dpi of the laser sensor a little bit and let's you get better beat on whoever you're to tract and we get to the pinky side of mouse, you assumed the there's another screw here, you can use the Allen wrench. and take this piece off and Mad Catz includes 2 other pinky pieces you can put in, of different textures and different sizes, so lets you customize that side of mouse as well. Mad Catz also includes a carrying box that you will put all the various pieces that you're not using outside. No for the last part of our customization, you see this wrist rest here. It's little tough on bottom, push it in and you can slide wrist piece right off. You get 2 other wrist piece options. To set up a little higher on this track, one sit is closer to flash. What's cool about this track is that you cannot only slide in new wrist pieces depending on the kind of feel you want there. You can also set them to be longer or shorter. So, if you got a bigger hands or smaller hands, you can adjust the wrist piece, so it fits perfectly. Now, running", "gen_completion": " back on track, lets take a look at the wrist rest area. The back of the wrist rest is actually the bottom part where you sit actually, it has another little slot you can put the 2 additional wrist pieces and also there's a soft silicone on the bottom where it comes in contact with your wrist to make sure that the wrist rest stays secure. You can also insert the whole wrist rest in the palm of your hand and set up with your preference here. Mad Catz also including a 3rd party adapter to make this wrist rest work with 3rd party mice or laptops with 3rd party mouse. But, if you don't want to use that adapter, then they've got a 2nd set of wrist pieces that sit more securely on the left and right edges of the wrist rest and actually the middle section of the wrist rest. Here you have another 2 styles of wire for you to choose from for the wrist rest. A more traditional looking one that you'll use with a mouse,"}

Various people who spoke to the Ghana News Agency on the day President Kufuor was inaugurated said he needed to do more to reconcile the nation.\nMr Mike Griffiths, a Director at Sunny FM, an Accra private radio station, noted that the reconciliation process initiated by the President and the Government was a good thing.\nHowever, in recent times, there had been certain actions and inactions by the New Patriotic Party (NPP), which impeded reconciliation.\n\"I was disappointed for instance to see the statue of Dr J.

Mr Akunu Dake, Chief Executive of Heritage Development, a Public Relations, Events Management and Hospitality Practitioners and Consultants, urged the President to be more indigenous minded in whatever decisions he took for the nation.\n\"The President should keep it in mind that no matter how well intentioned foreign support is, it can never solve all our problems unless we consciously develop and tap on the self-confidence of our own people.\"\nMr Dake said in the next four years he expected the President to approve only policies and programmes, which would fully integrate the contribution of Ghanaians in the national development process. Mrs Vivian Nuhu, a Wildlife Specialist at the Forestry Commission, said she expected the President to use the next four years to revamp the education system to ensure that education was made affordable from the nursery to the tertiary level.\nShe said education was the key to development and there was the need to widen the coverage as much as possible to ensure that many Ghanaians were educated.\n\"In recent times we've been talking about wealth creation, but that cannot be achieved effectively if the majority of our people remain illiterate.\"\nMrs Nuhu also noted that the education campaign on the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) was deceptive, saying that it created the impression that subscribers of the scheme would have all healthcare service for free.\n\"We all know that is not true and I expect the President to come out boldly and let his people do the right things,\" she said.\nMr Franklin Adumuah, a Waiter at La-Palm Beach Hotel, expressed disappointment about what he described as the President's silence about cases of corruption in his Government in the first four years.\n\"I will be glad to see the President come out to stem corruption in his own Government as he promised in the zero tolerance for corruption policy contained in the Positive Change Chapter One manifesto,\" he said, adding: \"The President cannot continue to pretend as if he does not know about the corruption cases in his Government.\"\nMs Bilikis Nuhu, Dress Designer at La in Accra, said she wanted to see salaries improve within the second four-year term of President Kufuor.\n\"I understand they said they want to half poverty by 2015 so by 2008 salaries should be high enough to keep Ghanaians above the poverty line.\"\nMr Gideon Allotey, Businessman, said: \"I want to see the President and his government focus on the fulfilment of the promises in the Positive Change Chapter Two manifesto because that is why we voted for them.\"\nMs Mavis Sowah, Nurse, shared Mr Allotey's concern, saying that the", "gen_completion": " two President's had the opportunity but failed to deliver.\n\"I know of so many who lost their jobs this year and it was because they failed to deliver on the promises we made,\" she said, adding that the President was not telling the whole of Ghana where all his money had gone in the past four years.\n\"Where are all the resources we voted for?\" she added.\nGNA\n0101200722;0105006717;0104805559;0104802611;0014012647;0014014675;0014013423;0014012238;0014011026;00140103870;00140107819;00140105540;00140105303;00140105259;00140105206;00140105193;00140105193;00140105193;00140105193;00140105"}

Though the characters are engaging and some of the ideas are more relevant than ever, the plot feels more like a hurried synopsis rather than an actual story. That makes the dramatic development suffer, which also makes it harder to care about the larger trilogy the movie is inevitability hoping to kick off.

The helplessness of the children and teens in the face of the guards is by far the most disturbing thing about the movie, and a more careful exploration of the idea of imprisoning children might have elevated the movie to profound, moving relevance.\nUnfortunately, the creative team had an entire novel\u2019s worth of plot to speed through. A painfully small number of Hollywood screenwriters seem to realize that novels and movies are structured almost entirely differently, and you do a story more justice by making the necessary adaptations rather than trying to simply shoehorn in the whole book.

On Thursday he told them it was their job to get a budget passed; he'd already done his work by proposing a plan that would raise sales taxes and add jobs. On Friday he sued.\n\"In the performance of his duties, President Stroger submitted his executive budget to the board's finance committee on October 17, 2007,\" says the complaint, filed in county court by Stroger, state's attorney Richard Devine, and sheriff Tom Dart, naming all 17 board members as defendants. \"All conditions precedent to the board's duty to adopt an Annual Appropriation Ordinance have taken place.\" The suit asks the court to order commissioners to keep meeting until they have a budget deal done and, in the event the deadline passes, to authorize county treasurer Maria Pappas to make payments to keep the government running.\nLate Friday word circulated that a deal might be in place. Commissioners would agree to raise the sales tax one percentage point in return for Stroger agreeing to farm out management of the county health system to a private firm--essentially a compromise floated earlier by commissioner Larry Suffredin.\nBut a last-minute deal isn't going to undo the impression of many taxpayers that the board is full of ineffective grandstanders and the government dismally managed.

{"prefix": "California has increased the capacity of its publicly-funded preschool program in recent years, but McCarty says it\u2019s still behind other states. The National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University ranks California 13th in state spending on preschool and 21st in total preschool spending, which also includes local and federal money.\nLawmakers have been working to expand preschool access dramatically for years, but Brown\u2019s interest in saving for an impending recession curtailed their efforts. Less than half of children from low-income families in California are in high-quality preschool programs largely because there are many eligible children but not enough space available, Cullinan said.\nMcCarty\u2019s proposal is not universal preschool, which many advocates have sought.\nMcCarty\u2019s main bill would expand the state\u2019s existing preschool program by about 50 percent to serve roughly 250,000 low-income kids. It will likely cost about $1.3 billion dollars over three years, McCarty said. He\u2019s also introducing bills to fund preschool construction and increase pay for preschool teachers.\nMcCarty said he and Newsom have talked about the issue generally, but not the specifics of his McCarty\u2019s plan. Newsom characterized preschool as a priority, but told McCarty proposals must be affordable.\nUnder the proposal, children would be eligible if they live in an area where at least 70 percent of students fall below a certain income level, generally less than $47,000 per year for a family of four. Children whose families make less than 85 percent of the state\u2019s median income are already eligible for the program.\nTargeting low-income families will expand access for the kids who face the biggest barriers to attending preschool, he said. The proposal would also create spots for some children from middle-income families who live in high-poverty areas.\nThe money would go to preschools run by school districts and nonprofits.\nSeventy percent of young mothers are in the workforce but 35 percent of them leave after having kids because they can\u2019t afford childcare or preschool, Cullinan said. Supporters of early education say affordable childcare and preschool are ultimately important steps in establishing economic security for all families in California.\n\u201cThis is a direct impact on our economy and on the success of the future of our state,\u201d Cullinan said.\nStanford University Professor Deborah Stipek, an early childhood education expert, thinks more investment in preschool is essential, but said she worries targeting only low-income families could have negative effects.\nThe state preschools\u2019 income requirements effectively segregate low-income children, she said. A better approach would be to provide financial assistance to families on a sliding scale, so children attending preschool together come from a range of backgrounds, Stipek said.\nResearch that has shown high-quality preschool can have dramatic benefits for children, but low-quality programs can have little to no effect, she said. Some schools provide nurturing programs that foster basic reading and math knowledge and keep children engaged, Stipek said. But others are lacking and have high staff turnover because they pay teachers so little.", "gen_completion": "\nThe amount of money California spends on early education is one element of a much broader agenda.

The current funding limits children\u2019s total square footage of the classroom, not the number of children enrolled, King said. Even if she doubles the program\u2019s total enrollment, which could double the number of kids accommodated, it\u2019s still only about half as large as it stands now, King said.\nKing isn\u2019t sure what McCarty is proposing would be enough"}
{"prefix": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The senator leading the charge to revive a assault weapons ban conceded on Sunday, just days before hearings on gun control open, that winning Senate passage will be tough but said she has been assured she will have the chance to bring it up for a vote.\nPresident Barack Obama, who has made gun control a top priority after 20 children and six adults were killed by a gunman on December 14 at a Connecticut school, said in remarks published on Sunday that gun control advocates should take into account the views of rural Americans who use guns for hunting.\n\u201cPart of being able to move this forward is understanding the reality of guns in urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural areas,\u201d Obama told The New Republic magazine as he continued his administration\u2019s outreach to gun owners even as he seeks new gun restrictions.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein said Majority Leader Harry Reid has promised that even if the assault weapons ban is left out of a broader package intended to curb gun violence, she will have the opportunity to offer it as an amendment on the Senate floor.\nFeinstein introduced legislation last Thursday to ban military-style assault weapons like the one used by the gunman in last month\u2019s school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and high-capacity ammunition clips.\n\u201cThis has always been an uphill fight.

That law expired in 2004 after 10 years in effect and Congress refused to extend it.\nNo major gun control legislation has made it through Congress in two decades in the face of opposition from the National Rifle Association and its gun rights allies.\nRepublicans generally oppose gun restrictions and many Democrats, particularly those representing rural areas, also support gun rights. Reid has been a long-time backer of gun rights.\nWayne LaPierre, chief executive officer and executive vice president of the Virginia-based NRA, is among the witnesses scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing on Wednesday on reducing gun violence.\nObama, in the magazine interview, said bridging a cultural divide in attitudes to gun ownership will be critical to his administration\u2019s push to curb gun violence.\n\u201cIf you grew up and your dad gave you a hunting rifle when you were 10, and you went out and spent the day with him and your uncles, and that became part of your family\u2019s traditions, you can see why you\u2019d be pretty protective of that,\u201d Obama said.\nObama", "gen_completion": " last year proposed increasing the minimum purchase age for buying AR-15 assault weapons to 21 and broadening the definition of a gun to include semi-automatic rifles like the one used by Newtown gunman Adam Lanza.

The day before, a gun control advocate\u2019s rally also is planned at a meeting between White House officials and gun control advocacy groups in Washington.\nLast week Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the chairman of the Senate\u2019s Judiciary Committee, said he would reintroduce the assault weapons ban with stronger provisions.

{"prefix": "Not every 79-year-old surgeon happens to run a tech incubator. Not every 79-year-old surgeon who runs a tech incubator happens to have a winery either. But Thomas Fogarty does. The doctor-entrepreneur-vintner, best known for inventing the angioplasty balloon, runs the Thomas Fogarty Winery just a few miles uphill from his medtech incubator at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View.\nThe non-profit Fogarty Institute for Innovation is based around a simple concept: Making life easier for small or early stage medtech firms developing cutting-edge products or tools. In an interview with Fast Company, Fogarty decried what he saw as the increasing cost of American medical innovation, and said that small medical companies need a safe environment for growth similar to those of lower-overhead conventional tech startups.\nSince its founding in 2007, the Institute has helped about a dozen small medical companies launch. Back in June, the Institute announced its latest crop of participants. The five new companies are primarily centered around providing services for expectant parents or newborn children. Among them are a non-invasive sensor that records fetal vital signs, a device that prevents vaginal tearing during childbirth, and a sensor set for clinicians giving urgent care to newborns.\nFirst Pulse Medical: First Pulse manufactures one of the first attempts at a heart rate monitor for fetuses during labor and delivery. The monitor uses proprietary light sensors to track a fetus's heart rate and oxygenation.\nInPress Technologies: InPress is testing a single-use medical device which quickly and effectively treats postpartum hemorrhaging (PPH) as it happens by stimulating vaginal contractions. One woman dies from PPH every four minutes.\nMaterna Medical: Materna is conducting tests in Australia on an anti-vaginal tearing device for women giving birth. The mechanical dilator is inserted during the first stage of labor and is designed to prevent vaginal tearing or pelvic damage during childbirth.\nMedical Cue: Medical Cue's NeoCue system is a combination sensor set/workflow organizing tool for childbirth. The system automatically gives medical professionals key physiologic data and real-time decision guidance.\nPrescient Surgical: Prescient Surgical's Cleancision device prevents dangerous surgical wound infections. This Stanford University spin-off is targeting a very specific market--obese patients undergoing colorectal surgery.\nDuring our conversation, which jumped from Fogarty's anger at the press for publishing (in his opinion) to many scare stories about medical innovation to the interaction between his institute and the larger Silicon Valley tech scene, he said something interesting. \u201cThe venture capital community has largely avoided medical companies because of the expenses associated with it. There are also many other problems, but primarily they're regulatory. We need more clinical research [for products] in addition to basic research... What we're doing at the Institute is trying to solve these issues.\" Fogarty also added that the institute works with entrepreneurs in other highly regulated industries to trade best practices on navigating bureaucracy, which is a common hurdle for health startups.\nThere are fewer industries more highly regulated than the medical profession. While transport apps like Uber have to deal with byzantine local taxi bureaucracies, medical startups face the FDA--an organization that is both costly and inefficient to deal with. Fogarty, along with many other biotech innovators I've spoken to, complains that the FDA is inefficient when it comes to evaluating new technology. It's not that the FDA is hostile to innovation; rather, it's that agency bureaucrats don't keep up with new research.\nWhat the Fogarty Institute tries to do is to make the regulatory and fundraising parts of getting off the ground easier for young medtech firms. Participating companies in the Innovation Cultivation incubator base themselves at the Institute and are given assistance with research", "gen_completion": " and pilot projects. The company often has its own in-house FDA inspector--who serves to help the company comply with all relevant regulations--and is given access to a clinical research network.\n\"Innovation is happening in small, innovative firms, because they're trying to do this more efficiently and it's happening more frequently,\" Fogarty told Fast Company.\nThe Institute is also offering mentorship for promising medtech companies, which can help with both product development and regulatory compliance. More advanced firms have also reached out to learn more about the institute's education and training programs. The startup has recently taken part in a seed program by a Massachusetts-based venture capital firm called Syleek Opportunities, which helps to secure Series A funding and provides training and support for emerging biotech firms. The startup will present its own business plan at an event hosted by Syleek Opportunities in Boston later this year. The company is also planning to host a booth on the opening day of the Web."}

But what's missing in this discussion is this: how secure is the NSA's spying system?\nIf a foreign entity wanted to spy on US companies or individuals, would it try to tackle the problem directly by targeting the specific company or individual in its electronic spying attempts?

{"prefix": "The morning before I attended the screening of the new X-Men movie, I was cleaning out an old box of mementos and came across an odd flyer. It read \u201cMutants Are People Too!\u201d on the cover. On the inner fold were details of how this country was full of Mutant Oppression and lacking Mutant Equality. I was given this flyer at the first screening of the original X-Men in 2000, when the studio staged a mock protest outside the theater. Actors made up as mutants handed out pamphlets and spoke out against the Senator Kelly character, played in the movie by Bruce Davison.\nIt\u2019s amazing (and maybe a little depressing) that there have been seven X-Men movies made in the past 14 years, and only a few of them are really good. The first two, directed by Bryan Singer, were made before the saturation of comic book movie adaptations we have today and remain impressive, thrilling and a lot of fun. The disappointing X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine were the underwhelming series lows, while the pretty good X-Men: First Class and the underrated The Wolverine mostly succeeded in capturing the gruff, imaginative essence of the series. Now, with Singer returning to direct a series installment for the first time since 2003, the franchise mostly escapes superhero movie fatigue by finding a brilliantly clever new angle to explore.\nThe complex plot opens with the world we know becoming a dark, dreary place in the near future. All mutants are hunted and killed by man-made machines called Sentinels and the X-Men crew is sparse and holed up in China, awaiting possible extinction. By a means too convoluted to explain, Logan (Hugh Jackman) is sent back in time to change the past. His mission: in order to save the future and change the past, he must recruit younger versions of his mentor, Professor X and his adversary, Magneto; not only must he convince them of his quest but also get the two longtime enemies to work together.\nAll of the scenes set in the future, with the familiar crew of mutants fighting off the Sentinels and taking part in effects-heavy mayhem, are tired and feel overly familiar. Once the story settles into the 1970s and becomes a delightful, engaging time travel action/comedy, the movie takes off. I won\u2019t describe it, but there is an incredible scene, set to Jim Croce\u2019s \u201cTime in Bottle,\u201d that astonishes by blending state of the art CGI, crafty cinematography and a wicked sense of humor. While the movie never tops this sequence, there are other set-pieces that deliver on the excitement and spectacle promised by the series.\nUninitiated audiences should see the first two entries, in order to get up to speed. But the story often helps the newcomers by offering flashbacks and exposition, making this feel almost like a stand-alone installment.

Scale is a competitive advantage. As a result, a combined Yahoo and Microsoft makes a great deal of sense,\" Financial analyst Clayton Moran from Stanford Group Company said in an e-mail interview after the results were released.\nAsked whether he sees Yahoo as being on the right track or not, Moran, who has a \"Hold\" recommendation on the stock and a 12-month target of $24 per share, said: \"Yahoo is struggling with no clear solution to reignite growth.\"\nStill, Yahoo's top executives repeatedly said, during a conference call to discuss the results, that they were pleased with Yahoo's performance considering the challenges it has faced, including adverse economic conditions and the distractions of the Microsoft acquisition bid and the strident controversies it has generated.\n\"We're executing and delivering against the strategy we laid out, even under extraordinary conditions,\" said CEO Jerry Yang.\nCFO Blake Jorgensen said the conversion of joint broadband deals with AT&T and Rogers Communications to a revenue-sharing format, in late 2007 and early 2008, have hurt Yahoo's revenue growth this year.\nYahoo also said it saw economic conditions affect advertising revenue, especially in categories such as finance, travel and retail.\nYahoo this week managed to reach an agreement with Icahn, who had proposed an alternate slate of director candidates for the Aug. 1 shareholder meeting in order to unseat the entire board. By expanding the board and granting Icahn three seats, Yahoo convinced the billionaire investor to call off the plan. Icahn had indicated previously that his intention was to unseat Yang as Yahoo CEO and attempt to lure Microsoft back to the negotiating table, a possibility that now seems remote.\nThe proxy-contest settlement \"eliminates the distractions and allows us to move forward,\" Yang said.\nThe deal with Google raised eyebrows, since Google's dominance in search advertising is a big reason why Yahoo has struggled financially. Search advertising makes up about 40 percent of all online ad spending, and Google has a stranglehold on that segment of the market.\nBy comparison to Yahoo, Google last week reported second-quarter revenue of US$5.37 billion, up 39 percent over the same quarter last year. Almost all of Google's revenue comes from search advertising. It earned $4.63 per share.\nThe Yahoo/Google search ad outsourcing deal is being reviewed by U.S. regulators and hasn't been implemented yet.\nYahoo has said the deal with Google will give it a revenue boost while allowing Yahoo to continue honing its search advertising business, a key component of a broad advertising strategy that also includes the display ad formats, an area where Yahoo traditionally has been strong.\nPresident Sue Decker said Yahoo is focusing on innovating in search technology, as opposed to trying to replicate the current models, because the company believes the search experience can be greatly improved.\nFor the third quarter, Yahoo expects revenue in the range of $1.78 billion", "gen_completion": " to $1.83 billion, which would be down 7 to 13 percent. Net income per share is projected between five and 15 cents, which would be in line with analyst forecasts. Operating income is expected to grow between 5 percent and 15 percent.

There, the warning time would be much longer.\nWashington is ahead of other tsunami-vulnerable states like Oregon, California, Alaska, and Hawaii.\nThe state already has one vertical evacuation structure.

{"prefix": "A new Yale study may help save the tigers.\nResearchers from the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies have come up with a form of spatial modeling to identify the areas of the Kanha Tiger Reserve National Park where the risk of tiger attacks on livestock is highest, in the hopes of reducing farmer-tiger conflict. The study holds potential for mitigating farmers\u2019 economic losses, but could also prove an important part of the conservation puzzle for the dwindling tiger population.\n\u201cIf we can understand what kind of landscape features these cats target when they\u2019re attacking livestock, then we can better predict where to graze, and predict where the high risk areas are,\u201d said Jennie Miller FES \u201915, the study\u2019s lead author who conducted the research for her dissertation.\nSimilar statistical models have been used in past research with wolves in the United States. Though Miller\u2019s model is based off of these, it is distinct because of the differences in large cats\u2019 hunting patterns.\nThe team studied the area within 20 square meters of each kill site. Though past models have focused on larger areas, tigers are more limited in their movements, and therefore, the wider radius is unnecessary.\nWild prey is available to the tigers, but so too is livestock, which the tigers may only attack when the opportunity arises \u2014 if a cow, for instance, had strayed into a densely forested area that the tiger already frequented. Thus, Miller said the model is likely to reduce attacks for many years to come because tigers are unlikely to shift behavior patterns in order to continue feeding on no-longer-easily-available cows.\nThe team worked in central India in the Kanha Tiger Reserve, where the large tiger population had produced more than 400 instances of attack on livestock within that year. The researchers partnered with the local livestock compensation program, through which farmers can report livestock lost to tiger predation to the forest department for reimbursement. This helped provide the team with the data they needed and began to elucidate the relationship between land features and risk.\nThough much of what the model predicted was relatively straightforward \u2014 attacks, for instance, were more frequent in areas farther away from villages and were less frequent in areas with less vegetation \u2014 it did help identify riskier areas in seemingly uniform landscapes.\nProfessor at the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and Miller\u2019s advisor Oswald Schmitz said that though policy to protect tigers already exists, Miller\u2019s work will prove that it really", "gen_completion": " isn\u2019t enough. Schmitz explained that while there are several conservation measures \u2014 including those the government already takes into account, such as grazing allotments \u2014 tiger protection should not just be thought of on a city-by-city basis, but spread over the larger landscape as a whole.\n\u201cIf you give tigers a hundred acres of space,\u201d Schmitz said, \u201cthat could help a lot of tigers. But you know, you still have to have protection on the entire area.\u201d\nThe researchers believe even though the model\u2019s predictions could help in reducing the risk of attacks, it has wider applicability in understanding the role the landscape plays in tigers\u2019 behavior in general.

A more thorough assessment of the living situation follows.\nThe regular fostering process involves an information session for the potential foster family, a pre-selection assessment and a full-fledged assessment. Only then is a contract signed.\nUlysse said every effort is made to match a family with a parenting environment within which the child will thrive.\nThe third type of foster care is called \u201cmixed bank\u201d. The goal in this scenario is to give the child a forever home. Although there is a permanency to the plan, it remains a fostering situation, with an option to adopt well down the line.\nIn the mixed-bank scenario, a contract is only signed if the foster family agrees to such a plan.\nDepending on the needs of the child, a foster family is paid somewhere between $1,500 and $1,800 per month, per child.\nIf the child is in need of specialized services, such as therapy for trauma or speech therapy, the CIUSSS makes sure the service is readily available through conventional avenues or, if the wait time is too long, it will pay for the service.\nOne of the biggest challenges Ulysse faces is keeping siblings together.

He also opposed the US troop withdrawal from Syria that Mr Trump announced on Wednesday, a move that has bewildered allies and triggered harsh reaction from Republican allies in Congress.\nMr Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the White House would not comment \"on future strategic developments\".\nThe US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said thousands of the 14,000 troops could be sent home as a result of the deliberations, the disclosure of which could undermine peace efforts with the Taleban.\nMr Trump privately has been grousing about US military involvement in Afghanistan, telling an ally as recently as Wednesday, words to the effect of: \"What are we doing there.

He resigned shortly after US officials raised the possibility that Mr Trump would order the drawdown.\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, often a vocal Trump ally, warned of possible danger to the US if the drawdown goes through.\n\"The conditions in Afghanistan - at the present moment - make American troop withdrawals a high risk strategy.

{"prefix": "By Don Edwards Don Edwards, US representative from California, is chairman of the House Subcommitte on Civil and Constitutional Rights. He was the floor leader for House passage of extension of the Voting Rights Act.\nIf President Reagan and a handful of conservative senators succeed in their scheme to require plaintiffs in Voting Rights Act cases to prove ''intent'' to discriminate, the results will be tragic for minority Americans. A key provision of the bill passed by the House of Representatives on Oct. 5, 1981, by the overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 389-24 will be struck down before it has become law.\nSection 2, which was designed in 1965 to remedy voting discrimination patterns wherever they might exist, authorizes the government or private individuals to ask the federal courts to stop discriminatory practices whether they occur in Mississippi, Alaska, California, or anywhere in the US. If President Reagan is successful in imposing his will, scores of blatantly discriminatory laws and pratices will be unreachable through lawsuits.\nWhen it approved the Voting Rights Act in 1965, it was Congress's intention that in lawsuits to enforce Section 2 the burden of proof on the complaining party not be limited to proof of intent or bad purpose. If discriminatory results were shown, a violation could be found. The House overwhelmingly restated this principle in extending the Voting Rights Act in 1981.\nSection 2 worked very well for the first 15 years of the Voting Rights Act. Suits were filed in jurisdictions where laws enacted many years ago had resulted in black citizens having little or no chance of being elected to local or state offices. These suits were not easy--they required a showing that an aggregate of factors were present in a particular jurisdiction.\nTo make this showing, substantial statistical and other evidence proving the discriminatory impact of voting and election practices and procedures in the local jurisdiction was needed. But important suits were won, and the 1965 intent of Congress in enacting Section 2 was being fulfilled.\nThen in April 1980 the US Supreme Court in a plurality, not a majority, decision overruled the lower court decisions and said that insofar as the City of Mobile, Ala. was concerned, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act could not be used to mandate single-member districts unless the officials who wrote the law back in 1911 had the intent to discriminate against blacks. The Court specifically said that it was not enough to prove the existence of an aggregate of factors, such as a history of segregation, discrimination in registration and voting, disproportionately low numbers of minorities elected to office, racial bloc voting, lack of responsiveness by local officials to minorities, and the lack of access to the political process.\nThe impact of the Mobile decision has been devastating. The US Justice Department abandoned its suit against South Carolina, 30 percent black, the sole remaining state in the Deep South with an all-white legislative body - the state senate. Indeed, a black has not been elected to the South Carolina state senate in this century. The Justice Department dismissed three additional suits, and dropped from consideration other possible suits in cities where black citizens have for decades been discriminated against in the electoral process.\nIn one case, a court, citing the Mobile decision, upheld an election system in Moultrie, Ga., where exclusion of blacks has gone so far that the town actually delegated the running of elections to an all-white social club.\nSince the Mobile decision in April 1980 the Justice Department has not inititated a single lawsuit under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\nMobile has made Section 2 virtually irrelevant. Old laws obviously designed to prevent the election to public office of black Americans can no longer be reached in courts of law.

The American people will be free to choose their elected officials through direct elections rather than a partisan system that has engendered a vast body of federal law. The integrity of our elections will be maintained.\nIn a highly unusual vote, the Senate voted 92-7 on Oct. 12 to protect Section 2. The House followed suit two days later with 407 votes for repeal.

{"prefix": "A \"vegetarian\" gene may have evolved amongst groups of people who have historically eaten less meat.\nA team at Cornell University describes the genetic variation in a study published inMolecular Biology and Evolution -- a variation that they say has \"evolved in populations that have eaten a plant-based diet over hundreds of generations\". That includes areas of India, Africa and East Asia, with a different variation adapted to a seafood diet found in Greenland.\nThe adaptation, the team says, allows those with the gene to \"more efficiently process omega-3 and omega-6 acids and convert them into compounds essential for early brain development and controlling inflammation\". The downside is that it might be linked to some types of cancer and other health problems.\nThe team looked at frequencies of particular alleles in 234 vegetarian people from India and 311 from the US, finding it in 68 percent of Indians and 18 percent of Americans. This is likely, they say, because Northern Europeans are more likely to eat meat and have \"a long history of drinking milk\".\nAdaptations between vegetarian and seafood diets is most striking -- the vegetarian allele has an insertion of 22 bases, something that's missing entirely from the seafood allele.\n\"The opposite allele is likely driving adaptation in the Inuit population,\" said Kaixiong Ye, co-lead author of the paper. \"Our study is the first to connect an insertion allele with vegetarian diets, and the deletion allele with a marine diet.\" \"Several studies have pointed to adaptation in this region of the genome", "gen_completion": ",\" said study co-author Jason W.

Alarm bells should also be ringing in the ears of residents living in these areas of the city.\nThe majority of people who expressed a no option to the HE preferred option during the public consultation are not anti housing, are not anti retail developments and welcomed the Louise Goldsmith initiative.\nHowever, the voice of concern for public health, has not been heard loud enough.\nI would argue that public health should trump any traffic construction solution, that is likely to increase traffic movements in the city. Subsequent to a High Court judgment, the Government (Department of Transport and DEFRA), has been forced to publish their July 2017 UK plan for tackling roadside nitrogen dioxide concentrations.\nIf CDC were really serious about an effective air quality plan, then the number one priority should be to have all options for the A27 back on the table and leverage the public health issue to obtain a share of the funding the Government has announced, (\u00a3255 million Implementation Fund).\nIf that is what is required to get a long term, non sticking plaster solution for the A27, then the public should rally around the BaBA27 initiative and challenge our local authorities to unite and deliver on that initiative.\nIt remains to be seen whether, or not, the outcome of the planned mid September full council meeting reflects the views, expressed by cllr Dignum from his straw poll, at the BaBA27 meeting.\nListed are some facts that should be of interest to the public.\nCDC own the AQAP and the Local plan.\nWSCC have public health & Highways Authority responsibility.\nFact 1 \u2013 In 2008, CDC produced an AQAP (air quality action plan) for the three areas previously mentioned.\nWe are now in 2017 and none of the three areas yet comply with the UK air quality objective. (Clearly traffic movements have increased since then), but no matter how the cake is cut, the AQAP is not delivering improvement.\nMy view \u2013 having read the latest revision, despite CDC having a very clear understanding of the challenges, it offers little or no action to bring about substantial improvement.\nFact 2 \u2013 The CDC AQAP states that particulate matter PM2.5 is a pollutant of significant importance regarding public health and, that the major contributor to Chichester not complying with air quality objectives is from cars.\nDiesel exhaust gasses and PM2", "gen_completion": ".5 also come from industry and are being directly affected by the development of this new area by way of the A27.\nBy taking the route of the A27 now, it is likely by the time the development reaches Chichester, that the majority of residents living in these areas will have no control over the development site. The air quality objectives will become moot; the UK Government will no longer be funding AQC (Air Quality Control) and a future plan will be required to deliver acceptable levels of air quality throughout the whole of the two districts.\nI know some people object to the construction of the A27 and the development that will bring it to Chichester. That is their decision to make. But it is my position that citizens whose lives are adversely affected by the construction of the A27 should demand action from our councils\nI am calling for CDC to provide more information to the public on how they intend to deliver any plan, that will address this issue of air quality."}

The Web has replaced the stage outside the covered wagon as the venue of choice, but the issues are still very relevant as word-of-mouth marketing and testimonials remain effective promotional strategies.\nSo, when is the line between creative publicity tactics and deceptive practices crossed? The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has maintained its Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising for decades. In 2009, the FTC updated the guides to, among other things, specifically address the use of testimonials in blogs, social media, and other online outlets.\nIt's a fairly simple premise - where there is a material connection between the speaker and brand that the audience would not other-wise reasonably infer, a disclosure is needed. One of the FTC's first enforcement actions after the new guides were issued was against a PR firm. Reverb Communications had hyped the products of its video-game clients by posting glowing reviews in the iTunes store without disclosing it was paid to promote those games.

{"prefix": "In my Tai Chi classes we learn how to pay attention to what we are doing, for it is fundamental to being able to relax, stay balanced and move well.\nSometimes the first and most important step in learning to pay attention is simply experiencing just how difficult it is to do so. Unfortunately most people give up at this point but it is worth considering the implications of spending most of our time being unaware of what is happening both in and around us.\nTo learn anything or develop any skill you have to able to pay attention. For me it is the single most useful attribute that anyone could develop to improve all aspects of their life. Paying attention means to intentionally focus on what is happening in the present moment (both internally and externally) at any given time. It is the art of noticing things without the distraction of thinking and judgement; the art of empirical observation. Paying attention is very simple. It is so simple in fact that it is usually overlooked by almost all of us but actually it underpins everything that we do. To begin with it can be a bit of a tricky skill to develop for it is easy to assume that you are paying attention when in fact your mind is wandering. By training little and often even small improvement can foster great benefits.\nIn terms of how we move and use our bodies it is our ability to pay attention that governs the quality of our actions. A good boxer in a bout, for example, focuses purely on what is happening; he pays attention. He watches and senses his opponent for any precursors to attack or discrepancies in his defence. He is completely in his body, engulfed by accurate real time sense perception. If his mind is dominated by thought then his performance is seriously impeded and a punch on the nose is the result; a sharp reminder not to be distracted by thoughts.", "gen_completion": " In Tai Chi we are not allowed to be distracted by thoughts or ideas. We are not allowed to have any thoughts, opinions or ideas. The idea of the \u201cself\u201d which so often fills up our mind is removed in order to focus on paying close attention during the movements that we are doing. However in order to make sure that we are really paying attention we do need to keep our minds under check by making sure that we are not thinking. I use the term \u201cmaintained control \u201d in this sense to mean that our minds must be \u201cmaintained as stable as a mountain for a certain period of time,\u201d otherwise a slight outflow of energy will cause us to wander and lose focus and attention.\nIt is the same for Tai Chi. If our attention is not totally on what we are doing, our performance will be seriously impaired.

{"prefix": "Officials are working to convince the public that a sweeping trade deal will help the planet.\nFacing criticism from green groups, the administration is making the case that a sweeping trade deal that President Obama is working to negotiate with Pacific Rim nations won't hurt the environment. In fact, officials argue, the agreement could go a long way toward protecting the planet.\nAs part of a push to sell the deal on Capitol Hill and to the American public, the U.S. trade representative and the State Department will unveil a report on Wednesday highlighting what they say are the potential environmental benefits of the international agreement, a pact that the president views as a cornerstone of his economic legacy.\nThe report arrives as Congress inches closer to passing so-called \"fast-track\" legislation backed by the White House, granting lawmakers an up-or-down vote on any trade deal.\nThe White House contends that the deal will bolster trade and help the United States maintain a competitive advantage in the face of China's rapid rise. But Democratic lawmakers, labor unions, and green groups remain wary of the agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, warning that it could undercut worker rights and erase key environmental safeguards.\nNow, the administration is pushing back against environmental criticism.\nFar from selling out the environment, officials say, the president has used trade as a lever to achieve far-reaching aims that will ultimately leave the environment in far better shape across a wide array of nations. Among those aims are agreements in the deal for countries to curb illegal wildlife-trafficking, fishing, and logging.\n\"We have the chance to finalize a trade agreement that is truly unlike any other ever negotiated: an agreement where every participant has to comply with core international labor and environmental standards.... That's not a complicated choice,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said during a speech delivered in Washington state on Tuesday.\nThe State Department and the U.S. trade representative promise that every last one of those environmental obligations will be fully enforceable and achievable.\nThe administration says it plans to provide assistance in the form of grants and technical support to developing nations such as Brunei, Vietnam, and Malaysia to ensure that they have the ability to follow through on environmental commitments.\nOfficials are also quick to note that nations can be taken to task if they fail to live up to their end of the deal. Any country found in violation could face a formal dispute, which could ultimately result in sanctions.\nObama's trade deal would go well beyond the environmental provisions included in past international agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. And a slate of conservation groups, including the World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy, have praised the administration for its pledge to create conservation safeguards in the agreement.\nThe White House hopes its push will win over critics. But it is unlikely to change hearts and minds among environmentalists dead set against the deal. Part of the reason is that many environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth, say that their criticism of the agreement applies to provisions much broader than anything contained within the environmental chapter.\nCritics from these groups fear that the deal will usher in an onslaught of legal challenges intended to undermine environmental regulations while opening the", "gen_completion": " country up to American products and businesses.\nSome believe that the administration's public case for the deal is also being undermined by a lack of public engagement in the process.

But it also included no information about the environmental chapter.\nDemocrats worry that a lack of details on the administration's plan to solicit input, combined with criticism about how the administration would solicit feedback, could cause lawmakers to question whether they can support the pact before it has been substantially vetted by members of Congress and White House staff.

{"prefix": "Above: A chatbot beats a travel app.\nMy travel season is coming up soon. I always attend CES in Las Vegas (let me know if you want to chat in person), the SxSW conference in Austin, and a few extra trips here and there. As I Iive up here in Minneapolis, it\u2019s the perfect time to escape the inevitable cold and snow.\nRecently, I\u2019ve been looking into travel options and, as a way to practice what I preach, I\u2019ve been relying entirely on messaging apps like Mezi (which uses AI to find the best deals). I\u2019ve talked to the Google Assistant on a Pixel smartphone I\u2019m testing and relied on chat interfaces. It\u2019s always interesting, as journalist, to apply what I\u2019m testing in my job to making actual plans. When you have to hand over your credit card information and other personal details, your perspective changes.\nAs it turns out, I learned quite a bit about why messaging works better for travel arrangements, mostly due to the time savings. It\u2019s amazing. On Mezi, I typed in my dates and the departure and arrival cities. That\u2019s it. The app is designed to make the process as fluid as possible, and it\u2019s all about finding the best deal. The app I normally use to book my own trips (when I even use an app instead of a website) is Expedia. Yet, I don\u2019t plan on going back to travel apps, and here\u2019s why.\nFirst, let\u2019s clear up one misconception. Making travel arrangements is not rocket science. There are a limited number of flights from Minneapolis to Las Vegas on the dates I\u2019m flying. For some reason, I always think if I spend an hour or more, I might find a better deal. That\u2019s rarely true.\nWhat is true is that most of the travel apps, even the ones that make big promises about saving you money, are searching the same basic airfare options. Sun Country offers roughly the same deal on every site, so a messaging app like Mezi already has a fairly limited number of options to analyze. From what I understand about how the app works, it searches for the best flights at the best times and provides three good options without too much help from a human agent.\nWhat\u2019s changed for me is that I trust the results. I know that these are likely the three best options, so I don\u2019t psyche myself out searching for more economical flights. It helps that I already know the flight should run about $300 or less (this is a vacation destination after all) and shouldn\u2019t make any stops.\nHere are some of the ways this saves me time. I don\u2019t have to use multiple travels apps and try to remember my login for each one. I don\u2019t have to fill out any forms \u2014 Mezi does that for me. I don\u2019t have to pick any flight preferences; Mezi saves this and fills it in. There are a few more subtle benefits, as well. I might need to update the Mezi app once in a while, but not as often as most of the apps I use, which seem to be constantly needing an update. Most of what needs to be updated in a messaging app is on the backend, not within the simple text interface.\nMaybe it\u2019s all an illusion, but I swear I saved about an hour. I have at least two more flights to book, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019", "gen_completion": "ll be using the message feature for those flights, which will still definitely save me some time. I\u2019ve also started using chat for general questions about the flight, like what airports it\u2019s available to land at, where it\u2019ll take off from, what the gate number or ramp number will be, etc. While I could do that in Mezi by typing in the question, that\u2019s not really an accurate representation of the flight, which is one reason the AI is better at the task. Mezi\u2019s flight and gate numbers mean more information about the flight, which makes it easier to find that data. You still spend time navigating through the interface to find a good deal or to find similar options if you\u2019re a traveler unfamiliar with the app. But it\u2019s much more straightforward than using an app like Expedia, where you need to check for your flight and gate repeatedly during the message conversation.\nThe bottom line\nIn short"}

He made five of his 11 shots from beyond the arc.

{"prefix": "Despite the obvious differences between the biggest IT markets of today, one thing that they all have in common is the importance of data. Focusing on that common thread, it might be easier than you think to shift from one market to a totally new one.\nAt least, that\u2019s what Modus Operandi, a small software company that serves the defense and intelligence communities, is doing as it pushes into the health care market.\nThe company\u2019s niche is semantic technology, which helps \u201cintelligence analysts find specific unique data and correlations of data within the multitude of databases across the intelligence agencies and the military services,\u201d said Rick McNeight, Modus Operandi president.\nIn practice, an intelligence analyst can put a query into a semantic wiki, such as the name of a known terrorist, at which point software will search relevant databases and automatically fill in the wiki with information not only about the terrorist, but about his associates, notable locations, and so on, McNeight said.\n\u201cWe don't just find a needle in a haystack; we find the right needle in the right haystack,\u201d he added.\nThe semantic technology capabilities that McNeight described are just as useful in health care as they are in the defense and intelligence space, and that\u2019s because of how semantic technology works.\n\u201cThe key to semantics is that you create intelligent kinds of models around people's data, and the models you create form these graphs,\u201d said Dr. Eric Little, vice president and chief scientist at Modus Operandi, said Dr. Eric Little, vice president and chief scientist at Modus Operandi.\nThese \u201cknowledge\u201d graphs, as Little called them, can be built into software systems, and analytics can translate them into understandable concepts and relationships, he said.\nDespite coming from a great number of sources, the data that goes into this process can be divided into three general groups: structured, semi-structured and unstructured, Little said.\nIn terms of Modus Operandi\u2019s defense and intelligence work, structured data can be database information, such as map information or people characteristics. Semi-structured data is derived from things like spreadsheets or from table information on the web. Unstructured data can be information that isn\u2019t necessarily stored somewhere, but is rather collected from various internet sources like social media sites.\n\u201cWe spend a lot of time in very large sects of this varying kind of data, and when you look at the health care space, you find a lot of striking similarities,\u201d Little said.\nHealth care data has continuously been collected over the past couple of decades, and especially in the past few years, there has been a push to digitize all of it for easier storage and access.\nWith Affordable Care Act requirements, there has been a push for doctors to not only convert to electronic means of communications, but that the newly electronic information be portable, searchable, and able to provide meaningful", "gen_completion": " data.\nThat\u2019s how semantic technology is going to play a role in how that data can be searched, Little said.\n\u201cThis is going to allow health care organizations to really quickly turn the data that currently sits in these database environments into information that is more useful and more easily understandable,\u201d he added.\nBut there\u2019s a potential for getting something wrong, or just running up against the limitations of what\u2019s currently out there.\n\u201cYou are not going to do much good at all in the health care space if you are not going to take into account the types of challenges that are being created by the digitization of health care,\u201d Little said.\nBut the technology will help create a more sophisticated and advanced semantic tool, so even if there are mistakes in the data, or it\u2019s data that\u2019s way too basic to take full advantage of the technology, it\u2019ll be easier than it probably would"}

{"prefix": "Republicans are, naturally, united in their opposition to the preliminary deal the Obama administration struck with Iran to restrain its nuclear program. And now, the presidential candidates in particular are going to compete with each other to see who can make their opposition more categorical. They're all criticizing it, of course, and Scott Walker has already said that on the day of his inauguration, he'll pull out of the deal. I'm guessing the rest of them will follow suit and pledge something similar. The question is: OK, so on January 20, 2017, you announce that we're out of the deal (since we're in the Republican fantasy world for the moment, let's put aside the involvement of Europe and the UN). What happens next?\nWell for starters, the Iranians would no longer be constrained by the things they agreed to. They could kick out all the inspectors and institute a crash program to create a nuclear weapon if they wanted. Are Republicans saying that Iran would never do that? I don't think so. Yet in practice, the Republican position seems to be: 1) We can never trust the Iranians to adhere to the terms of any nuclear deal we sign with them because of their insatiable thirst for nuclear weapons, so 2) If there's no agreement at all\u2014no limits on nuclear research, no limits on the quantity and purity of uranium they can enrich, no inspections\u2014then everything will be OK.\nTo be clear, I'm not saying this deal is perfect, though a lot of people who know a lot about this issue are arguing that it's far stronger than what they expected (see here, for instance). But Republicans aren't saying we need to reopen negotiations and push for something better. They're just saying we should scrap the agreement, and then... well, they actually don't say what happens then.\nIn effect, the Republican argument is, We've put this dangerous criminal in prison, but I don't think this prison is secure enough.

It's being painted as `PostScript for the Web'. Is that right?\nThe whole thing is it brings freer exchange of information between PDF and PostScript so you can print any digital document without losing look and feel. It's a new paradigm of distribute-and-print, rather than print-and-distribute. It's a complete democracy of where you print. We do it all so users don't have to worry about it. For example, in the office where you have a PostScript Level 2 printer you would push a PostScript file byte by byte so it would be slow. PDF is structured in much more intelligent way so that's not necessary.\nIt was a mistake to introduce [PostScript] Level 2 and leave it a year before products and longer for drivers. Drivers will be available immediately with the release of Level 3. Level 3 will be much more of an architecture. Level 2 was a new Red Book. We'll work closely with Microsoft, Apple and others to bring a new component system into place.\nWhen can we expect the first Level 3-based products?\nThe first products will ship in the third quarter of 1997. We're announcing now because we want ISVs to become aware of it although we'll openly publish very little until the first products appear.\nHow much will HP's decision not to use PostScript in the future hurt you?\nIt's a double-edged sword. HP's defection isn't a sign that they don't [like Adobe technology]. To Adobe, it's a revenue and PR loss but it's a recognition that HP sees us as too dominant. On the other hand it allows us to be far more aggressive in positioning ourselves against PCL, which we haven't been able to do in the past. HP hasn't abandoned us; it's only the laser printer side.\nBut I think they've shot themselves in the foot. If you look at the way printing is going, it's all towards colour and speed.

The Dodgers held a $6 million team option to on Freese, but paid him a $500,000 bonus and then signed him to a one-year, $4.5-million deal.\nThe Dodgers have until 2 p.m. Friday to extend the one-year, $17.9 million qualifying offer to their free agents. Yasmani Grandal and Hyun-Jin Ryu are candidates to receive the offer. Manny Machado, another free agent, isn\u2019t eligible to receive the qualifying offer because he was traded during the season. If the offer is extended and declined, and the player signs elsewhere, the Dodgers would receive a compensatory pick in next June\u2019s draft.\nThe Dodgers have until 10 days after the season \u2014 Nov. 7 at 9 p.m. \u2014 to exercise the $1.1 million team option on manager Dave Roberts\u2019 contract. The Dodgers engaged Roberts in contract discussions during the season without reaching an agreement. Roberts has said he would like to return and the Dodgers have said they would like to retain him.\nOn Thursday, Friedman and Zaidi defended Roberts\u2019s decision-making during the World Series, particularly in Game 4 when he pulled pitcher Rich Hill in the seventh inning with a four-run lead after Hill had held the Red Sox scoreless over 6 1/3 innings.\nFriedman and Zaidi attributed the team\u2019s troubles in the World Series to the offense\u2019s struggles. Machado was acquired during the regular season to help the Dodgers avoid those spells, but the shortstop went 4 for 22 with a walk and zero extra-base hits in the five games while adding to his reputation as someone allergic to hustling. Machado is expected to sign a mega contract this winter as either a shortstop or third baseman.\nThe Dodgers have third baseman Justin Turner under contract for $39 million the next two seasons and are \u201coptimistic\u201d that Corey Seager, whose injuries created the hole at shortstop that Machado filled, will be ready for Opening Day next spring. Seager has undergone elbow ligament replacement and hip surgeries. A return to Los Angeles for Machado is unlikely.\nTo retain Machado \u2014 or sign slugger Bryce Harper or any other marquee free agent \u2014 would almost certainly require the Dodgers to surpass the luxury tax threshold. That\u2019s a line they mindfully dropped under in 2018. Asked whether the front office had been approved to venture into that territory, Friedman was coy.\nNow the onus is on Friedman and Zaidi to reconfigure the club over the next few months and place it in the best position to return to", "gen_completion": " the World Series.\nRookie reliever Joe Kelly was the Dodgers\u2019 most prominent addition over the first weeks of the offseason as he signed for $15.15 million, or $2 million less than the top earner, right-handed pitcher Clayton Kershaw\u2019s 13-year deal. The Dodgers haven\u2019t made a major splash with other significant contracts.\nFreeway Series\nFor the first three World Series in franchise history, the Dodgers faced off against the Red Sox in the World Series and went 1-2 at Fenway Park. The Dodgers didn\u2019t exactly play well. The only highlight was their five-hit, five-run homer by Yasiel Puig. But their offense, which had been plagued by injuries, appeared to reaccelerate. Puig was on fire, batting.386 with five extra-base hits. Cody Bellinger hit.350/.452/.696 in the series.\nThe Dodgers appeared ready to compete for their sixth"}
