Look no further than the example of BP.\nAs one of the world's largest oil producers, BP has a troubled safety record.

This plant also reported 23 worker fatalities in the three decades that preceded the 2005 accident.\nWhen Marathon Petroleum, the fourth-largest oil refiner in the U.S., bought the plant from BP, many in the industry thought it was a risky move. But Marathon had ideas for how to rectify the situation by instituting a culture centered on safety.\nRemedying the culture required a review of the plant's existing safety procedures. Following the 2005 explosion, federal investigators pointed to BP's problematic safety culture -- for example, with managers who were \"checking off boxes\" rather than promoting best practices for safety -- as the cause of the plant's many safety problems. BP failed to respond and paid dearly for its inaction in 2010, when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, killing 11 and spilling more than 3 million barrels of oil. The incident cost the company $54 billion in damages.\nAs BP's record illustrates, organizational culture matters a great deal to employee safety. Cultures in which employees are engaged in their work are safer places to work. Gallup's 2016 meta-analysis study -- which examined more than 82,000 business units and 1.8 million employees in 230 organizations, across 49 industries and in 73 countries -- shows that business units with engagement scores in the top quartile of Gallup's employee engagement database have 70% fewer safety incidents compared with bottom-quartile units.\nTheir employees are committed to doing quality work.

When employees are dedicated to quality, they go the extra mile to do things right the first time. By taking the right strategic action -- for example, by holding employees accountable for quality -- leaders can develop a workforce that makes smart decisions throughout the day and promotes a culture of workplace safety.\nThe mission or purpose of the company makes employees feel their job is important. Many of the world's most engaged organizations maintain a purpose-driven culture. Their leaders know why the company exists and ensure that employees understand and identify with that purpose. When workers embrace the mission of an organization and connect with that purpose both personally and professionally, they are more likely to think \"big picture\" in all areas of their work. Employees who are aligned with the company's mission are also more likely to approach their work with thoughtfulness and attention to detail, which contributes to a culture of safety.\nEmployees feel that their opinions count. It's a simple notion: Listen to workers who are closest to the action.

Naughty Dog also took an opportunity to boost up the game's frame-rate from the barely-hitting-30 frames per second on the PlayStation 3 to 60 buttery frames per second on the PlayStation 4.\nNaughty Dog decided to leverage the power of the PlayStation 4 to up the core specs of the award-winning 2013 outing from Sony.\nThe Last of Us Remastered includes all the previously released content for the game, including the DLC and add-ons that found a kind home on the PlayStation 3. Players will get the extra content for free, including the single-player and multiplayer content.\nThere have also been rumors that new DLC is being planned to release for both the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4 versions of the game at some point down the line. The DLC is supposed to be a brand new multiplayer map pack that will extend the replay for players who like to get competitive against one another in the online portion of the game.\nFor those of you who don't know what The Last of Us is about, the game follows Joel and Ellie as they trek across America to Baltimore.

The Last of Us: Remastered is dropping on the PlayStation 4 tomorrow. The new version includes increased visual fidelity, better graphics enhancements, as well as native 1920 x 1080p. Naughty Dog also took an opportunity to boost up the game's frame-rate from the barely-hitting-30 frames per second on the PlayStation 3 to 60 buttery frames per second on the PlayStation 4. Naughty Dog decided to leverage the power of the PlayStation 4 to up the core specs of the award-winning 2013 outing from Sony. The Last of Us Remastered includes all the previously released content for the game, including the DLC and add-ons that found a kind home on the PlayStation 3. Players will get the extra content for free, including the single-player and multiplayer content. There have also been rumors that new DLC is being planned to release for both the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4 versions of the game at some point down the line. The DLC is supposed to be a brand new multiplayer map pack that will extend the replay for players who like to get competitive against one another in the online portion of the game. For those of you who don't know what The Last of Us is about, the game follows Joel and Ellie as they trek across America to Baltimore. Joel is an older guy who suffered through some terrible tragedies 20 years prior to the game's time frame where the current events take place. After suffering the tragedy Joel takes to the bottle and at some point his life starts to spiral downward, until he makes one of the best decisions in a game when he decides to take Ellie back to her hometown. The game features plenty of dark humor, but it also has some heartfelt moments that some fans may have forgotten about. The Last of Us isn't a game for the weak, and the emotional moments are meant to tug at the heartstrings of players who care about the two main characters.

The engineers included new work benches and tool cabinets to create a more productive workspace. In addition, the space boasts a new locker room and two new break areas. The room has improved lighting and the open floor plan offers flexibility to modify the space to meet the needs of future workload. The 30,000-square-foot enclosure boasts a raised floor that can be easily reconfigured for changing mission needs and is certified according to aerospace quality standards and electrostatic dissipation requirements. The project was designed in accordance with the U.S. Army Green Building Council, to ensure the building was designed for energy efficiency and to reduce its impact on the environment. \"We have done an amazing job of developing and implementing a sustainable strategy and we are now seeing the results of the work accomplished over the past two years,\" said Tobyhanna Vice President of Operations, Joel Sommers.

A second EP, Foreword, continued to cultivate a fan base, and demonstrated her appeal as a complete, wild-maned package.\nIt was 2015, though, that signaled Kelly's rise into official breakthrough artist territory. At the 2015 Billboard Music Awards, and armed with only an acoustic guitar, she tore through \"Nobody Love,\" her debut album's first single, and delivered what was generally considered to be the show's most striking performance. Unbreakable Smile's release a month later was proof of the broadcast's power \u2014 the LP debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and \"Nobody Love,\" which peaked inside Billboard's Top 20, was certified gold. By pairing an enduring singer-songwriter sound with more explosive tracks like \"Expensive,\" Kelly honored her most devoted fans while opening herself up to a more mainstream audience.\n\"Should've Been Us,\" released next, also went gold.\nAs pop began to embrace Kelly's relaxed attitude and penchant for producing radio-worthy hits, she reminded everyone with a tribute to Smokey Robinson at the 2015 BET Awards that she was, at her core, a soul artist.

This was my life before this was 'American Idol.'\"\nIt was that sense of purpose, of having a message to share and a platform to grow from, that led to Kelly's current position on the cusp of the top tier of pop's upper echelons. The 25-year-old has now sold 2.5 million copies of Unbreakable Smile and is a No. 2 hitmaker behind the ubiquitous Taylor Swift. \"Everybody has their favorite artists,\" Kelly explains. \"No one is on the same wavelength as everybody else, and it's a lot of fun to be able to create music with people", "paraphrase_outputs": {"lex_40_order_100": {"final_input": "lexical = 40, order = 100 By Monday night, 23-year-old Tori Kelly might be in possession of her very first Grammy.

A second EP, Foreword, continued to cultivate a fan base, and demonstrated her appeal as a complete, wild-maned package. It was 2015, though, that signaled Kelly's rise into official breakthrough artist territory. At the 2015 Billboard Music Awards, and armed with only an acoustic guitar, she tore through \"Nobody Love,\" her debut album's first single, and delivered what was generally considered to be the show's most striking performance. Unbreakable Smile's release a month later was proof of the broadcast's power \u2014 the LP debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and \"Nobody Love,\" which peaked inside Billboard's Top 20, was certified gold. By pairing an enduring singer-songwriter sound with more explosive tracks like \"Expensive,\" Kelly honored her most devoted fans while opening herself up to a more mainstream audience. \"Should've Been Us,\" released next, also went gold. As pop began to embrace Kelly's relaxed attitude and penchant for producing radio-worthy hits, she reminded everyone with a tribute to Smokey Robinson at the 2015 BET Awards that she was, at her core, a soul artist. Fans \u2014 old and new \u2014 went wild on Twitter after her rendition of \"Who's Lovin You.\" Even Snoop Dogg, who watched the broadcast from his living room, gave the young singer a shout-out on his own feed. \"It was such an honor to perform that song,\u201d she told The L.A. Times last summer. \u201cTo honor Smokey, to honor my mother, to sing to my grandmother and my great-grandmother, all of whom I talk to every week, it really opened up a lot of eyes. That was my life before it was 'American Idol.' \" It was this combination of a sense of purpose and a platform for her voice to soar that has led Kelly to the very top of pop's highest echelons. <sent> 2 hitmaker behind the ubiquitous Taylor Swift. \"Everybody has their favorite artists,\" Kelly explains. \"No one is on the same wavelength as everybody else, and it's a lot of fun to be able to create music with people </sent>", "output": ["broadcast from his living room, gave the young singer a shout-out on his own feed. \"It was such an honor to perform that song,\u201d she told The L.A.

And it should obviously remain heavily guarded. But Macs purchased one year ago or before, apparently, leave a door open. When a Mac goes into sleep mode and wakes back up, it allows direct access to the BIOS. It's a weird quirk that lets someone tamper with the code there.

In commitment to our Constitution, our nation has placed great priority on a dedication to this well-guarded peace. Similarly, over the past fifty years, Department of Defense innovation and technology has made our military the most technologically advanced in the world. Now, in the 21st century, dedication to harnessing top-of-the-line technology is even more necessary. We live in a post 9/11 society. We\u2019ve known for some time now that there are those who actively seek to do our nation harm by targeting our buildings, our city streets, and public events. We also know that terrorist organizations are actively pursuing chemical, nuclear, and biological weaponry. Quite simply, there are those who want to hurt America and rob us of our freedoms. Our Founding Fathers knew that these freedoms were so precious that they were worth protecting and worth defending. They also knew, as we know today, that one of the realities of having these freedoms is that there will always be individuals who want to take them from us. To lack vigilance in our investment in national security fails a central tenet of our constitutional duty \u2013 outlined in the first sentence of the Constitution \u2013 to provide for the common defense. There\u2019s no doubt that reconciling defense spending with our rapidly increasing national debt and deficit is a big task. Admiral Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has called our national debt this country\u2019s \u201cbiggest national security threat.\u201d There is plenty of waste at the Pentagon and we need to do our due diligence in making sure every defense dollar is treated as an investment. That\u2019s why I have supported legislation to audit the Department of Defense to ensure that every taxpayer dollar is well spent. However, we cannot use the national debt as an excuse to jeopardize our national security. Washington can \u2013 and must \u2013 get its fiscal house in order without cheapening our national security. Today, the danger of eroding our defense budget stretches beyond the battlefield. The ripple effects don\u2019t just touch our men and women in uniform, federal workers or defense civilians. The losses impact every rung of the American way of life \u2013 from Americans providing for their families by heading to work every day, to cheering spectators at a marathon.

Saleh Afihima, a member of the HoR and a supporter of \"Operation Dignity\" led by renegade General Khalifa Haftar, agrees with al-Merash. He believes that no one can deny Saif al-Islam's constitutional right as a Libyan citizen, so long as there are no judicial restrictions to prevent him from running. In 2013, a law was passed banning Gaddafi-era officials from holding public office. The law was later revoked in 2015. Aguila Saleh, president of the HoR, said that as a Libyan citizen, Saif al-Islam has the right to run, since the lifting of the ban three years ago. He added that unless prevented by judicial restrictions, the choice of his election is in the hands of Libyans. Afihima told Al Jazeera that Libyans need to recognise supporters of the former regime as part of the Libyan fabric, warning that intolerance towards any Libyan would have catastrophic consequences on the national reconciliation process. He also said that all parties must adhere to democracy, without excluding opposing views, \"if we [Libyans] want to reach a real state\". The Gaddafi regime still enjoys the support and loyalty of some tribes, especially in the south and the Warshefana region in Tripoli, as well as a number of tribes in Sirte, the birthplace of the late president. G Saif al-Islam was forced to flee Tripoli in August 2014 after his brother, Haftar, led the Libyan National Army to expel the former regime. Libya has been in turmoil since the downfall of the Gaddafi regime in 2011. A war between Haftar's troops and the UN-backed government in Tripoli has been underway since April, killing hundreds and displacing hundreds of thousands.

As Texas counted the dead and tallied up the billions of dollars in damage caused by Harvey, South Asia saw 1,200 deaths and millions of people made homeless by unusually powerful monsoon rains that left cities in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan under water. In July, unprecedented rains flooded subway stations and turned streets into lakes in Istanbul, one of Europe\u2019s most populous cities. There\u2019s no doubt about it: With drastic climate change, the world is experiencing historic storms more often. Hurricane Katrina did to New Orleans and southern Louisiana in 2005 what Harvey did to Houston and surrounding environs this year - an entire metropolitan area was affected, and the impact will be long-lasting. Hurricane Rita, which followed Katrina in 2005, served as a stark wake-up call for Houston, which was well-prepared for the wind event but could have never foreseen the floods wrought by Harvey. Superstorm Sandy in 2012 put New York City on notice that it was not immune to the effects of climate change. Flooded subways and major Internet switching centers in Manhattan were a reality and not fodder for disaster movies. The Carolinas were continuing to rebuild from 2016\u2019s Hurricane Matthew unprecedented flooding when Harvey struck Texas. Trump, who has ignored the reports of scientists warning that climate change is a hoax and that efforts to combat climate change put people\u2019s lives and property at risk, has remained silent as devastating hurricanes continue to wreck havoc, destroy property and put people at risk. What should Trump say? Nothing. <sent> He\u2019s a climate denier who believes that the planet is not warming, that climate scientists are part of a vast conspiracy and who would rather deny the growing evidence of the damage that is being done to the earth by human actions than admit that he is wrong and act to curb rising greenhouse gases that are causing the world\u2019s climate to warm and sea levels to rise. The president\u2019s decision not to immediately cancel his Florida trip shows he is not willing to admit failure. Instead, he would rather go golfing with his \u201cfriends\u201d who would not hesitate to cut in front of the president and would be willing </sent>", "output": ["Trump, who has ignored the reports of scientists warning that climate change is a hoax and that efforts to combat climate change put people\u2019s lives and property at risk, has remained silent as devastating hurricanes continue to wreck havoc, destroy property and put people at risk.

Lynton Crosby\u2019s last text to me predicted that we were going to \u2018do well\u2019, which according to our expectations would mean a Conservative majority of more than 60. A late projection, based on data from the ground and Jim Messina\u2019s modelling, suggested we would win 371 seats, giving us a majority of 92. In the end, the Conservatives got their highest share of the vote since 1983, and more votes than Tony Blair managed in any of his elections, yet still we ended up with a hung parliament.\nSkilful leadership may deliver stability, but the absence of an overall majority means the nature of the Brexit deal the government negotiates is more uncertain. There has long been talk of a choice between \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 forms of Brexit, with the latter requiring membership of the EU\u2019s single market. Since that would involve accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, vast annual membership payments to the EU, and the continuation of free movement rules, people who voted to leave the European Union might wonder whether advocates of a \u2018soft\u2019 departure really do understand that Brexit means Brexit.\nBecause this election failed to produce the majority we needed, it is impossible to call the campaign anything but a failure. Before it began, we envisaged a return to traditional campaigning methods, with daily press conferences to scrutinise Labour and promote our policies. Theresa, never comfortable hogging the limelight, expected to make more use of her ministerial team. On the advice of the campaign consultants, and following opinion research that showed Theresa to be far more popular than the party or her colleagues, we eschewed our instincts. We were wrong to do so.\nMy biggest regret, however, is that we did not campaign in accordance with the insight that took Theresa to Downing Street in the first place. While the referendum result was undoubtedly an instruction for Britain to leave the EU, it was also a vote for change. One can disagree with Theresa\u2019s prescription \u2014 a strategic role for the state to broaden economic opportunity, a clampdown on corporate excesses, rights for workers, intervention in dysfunctional markets and, through school reform, house-building and tax policy, a determination to make Britain the world\u2019s Great Meritocracy \u2014 but it is very difficult to disagree with her diagnosis.\nThat is why the Conservative manifesto, which I authored jointly with the brilliant Ben Gummer, rejected \u2018untrammelled free markets\u2019 and \u2018selfish individualism\u2019, and declared that \u2018our responsibility to one another is greater than the rights we hold as individuals\u2019. I was surprised to read some commentators describe these statements as \u2018left-wing\u2019 when the manifesto was consciously Burkean in its style and substance. Burke\u2019s great revelation was that if we value something, we must be prepared to reform it in order to keep it. I fear the election will cause many to conclude that we should return to the modern consensus politics of pure social and economic liberalism, which I believe is one of the causes of the division we see in Britain today.\nThe manifesto was later written off as \u2018the worst in history\u2019. One of the criticisms is that, instead of offering voters giveaways and bribes, we spelt out where cuts would fall.

In the end, the Conservatives got their highest share of the vote since 1983, and more votes than Tony Blair managed in any of his elections, yet still we ended up with a hung parliament. Skilful leadership may deliver stability, but the absence of an overall majority means the nature of the Brexit deal the government negotiates is more uncertain. There has long been talk of a choice between \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 forms of Brexit, with the latter requiring membership of the EU\u2019s single market. Since that would involve accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, vast annual membership payments to the EU, and the continuation of free movement rules, people who voted to leave the European Union might wonder whether advocates of a \u2018soft\u2019 departure really do understand that Brexit means Brexit. Because this election failed to produce the majority we needed, it is impossible to call the campaign anything but a failure. Before it began, we envisaged a return to traditional campaigning methods, with daily press conferences to scrutinise Labour and promote our policies. Theresa, never comfortable hogging the limelight, expected to make more use of her ministerial team. On the advice of the campaign consultants, and following opinion research that showed Theresa to be far more popular than the party or her colleagues, we eschewed our instincts. We were wrong to do so. My biggest regret, however, is that we did not campaign in accordance with the insight that took Theresa to Downing Street in the first place. While the referendum result was undoubtedly an instruction for Britain to leave the EU, it was also a vote for change. One can disagree with Theresa\u2019s prescription \u2014 a strategic role for the state to broaden economic opportunity, a clampdown on corporate excesses, rights for workers, intervention in dysfunctional markets and, through school reform, house-building and tax policy, a determination to make Britain the world\u2019s Great Meritocracy \u2014 but it is very difficult to disagree with her diagnosis. That is why the Conservative manifesto, which I authored jointly with the brilliant Ben Gummer, rejected \u2018untrammelled free markets\u2019 and \u2018selfish individualism\u2019, and declared that \u2018our responsibility to one another is greater than the rights we hold as individuals\u2019. I was surprised to read some commentators describe these statements as \u2018left-wing\u2019 when the manifesto was consciously Burkean in its style and substance. Burke\u2019s great revelation was that if we value something, we must be prepared to reform it in order to keep it. I fear the election will cause many to conclude that we should return to the modern consensus politics of pure social and economic liberalism, which I believe is one of the causes of the division we see in Britain today. The manifesto was later written off as \u2018the worst in history\u2019. One of the criticisms is that, instead of offering voters giveaways and bribes, we spelt out where cuts would fall. While I accept that the manifesto might have been too ambitious, I worry that the implication of this argument is that politicians should not be straight with the electorate. The Labour manifesto, which Jeremy and his colleagues developed with such valour, offers voters no choice but to reject austerity. In contrast, a government led by our candidate, Jeremy Corbyn, would have given them a clear choice. If Labour is going to win, and there is every indication that it will, then it must make a choice. Or, alternatively, it could abandon the economic policies that have so enthused the nation and seek to change everything that has united us. The result clearly showed that, unlike the government, Labour stands for nothing but change. <sent> Jeremy and I believe that the choice between our political vision and the choice of the British people requires such a radical intervention into the lives of ordinary families that the alternative will be unthinkable to most of the population.

{"prefix": "To get across Dublin city from, for example, St Vincent\u2019s University Hospital on the southside to Beaumont on the northside or to Connolly in the west could take 30 minutes at a quiet time of the day. At rush hour, it could take double that or even more.\nWith that in mind, nursing organisations are asking why would the Government be looking for a provision in a controversial new contract that would allow nurses working in Dublin to be moved between locations on opposite sides of the capital during a single shift, given the practical difficulties that may present.\nNursing unions and public service management will on Tuesday attend the Labour Court in a bid to resolve differences on a new contract which have complicated and could even threaten the proposed settlement to the recent nurses\u2019 strike.\nThe introduction of a new contract formed a key element of the original Labour Court recommendation that led to the suspension of the strike.\nNurses had been seeking pay parity with other graduate-entry groups such as physiotherapists who, they maintained, earn about \u20ac7,000 a year more.\nUnder the proposals, a new enhanced nurse grade would be introduced to which nurses could migrate after three years. Those moving on to the new grade would receive a salary increase of \u20ac2,439 or 7.3 per cent. The deal would also see significantly more nurses qualifying for additional allowances. However, there were also to be new cost-saving measures in a new contract to offset the cost of the proposed deal which could run to \u20ac50 million by the end of 2020.\nThe Irish Nurses\u2019 and Midwives\u2019 Organisation (INMO) initially urged members to back the Labour Court recommendation. However, when the Government\u2019s contract proposals were leaked, they caused consternation.\nThe Irish Times reported at the beginning of March that the Government wanted provisions to transfer nurses between locations \u2013 potentially within a 40km radius \u2013 for weeks at a time or even within a single shift.\nThe Government proposals could also see nurses rostered to work shifts lasting four, six, eight, 10 or 12 hours.\nThe INMO had seen the new contract as a potential opportunity to modernise nursing practices.

The Government has faced a barrage of questions on the financial details of the new contract.\nSources have said the nurses\u2019 proposals will", "paraphrase_outputs": {"lex_40_order_100": {"final_input": "lexical = 40, order = 100 To get across Dublin city from, for example, St Vincent\u2019s University Hospital on the southside to Beaumont on the northside or to Connolly in the west could take 30 minutes at a quiet time of the day. At rush hour, it could take double that or even more. With that in mind, nursing organisations are asking why would the Government be looking for a provision in a controversial new contract that would allow nurses working in Dublin to be moved between locations on opposite sides of the capital during a single shift, given the practical difficulties that may present. Nursing unions and public service management will on Tuesday attend the Labour Court in a bid to resolve differences on a new contract which have complicated and could even threaten the proposed settlement to the recent nurses\u2019 strike. The introduction of a new contract formed a key element of the original Labour Court recommendation that led to the suspension of the strike. Nurses had been seeking pay parity with other graduate-entry groups such as physiotherapists who, they maintained, earn about \u20ac7,000 a year more. Under the proposals, a new enhanced nurse grade would be introduced to which nurses could migrate after three years. Those moving on to the new grade would receive a salary increase of \u20ac2,439 or 7.3 per cent. The deal would also see significantly more nurses qualifying for additional allowances. However, there were also to be new cost-saving measures in a new contract to offset the cost of the proposed deal which could run to \u20ac50 million by the end of 2020. The Irish Nurses\u2019 and Midwives\u2019 Organisation (INMO) initially urged members to back the Labour Court recommendation. However, when the Government\u2019s contract proposals were leaked, they caused consternation. The Irish Times reported at the beginning of March that the Government wanted provisions to transfer nurses between locations \u2013 potentially within a 40km radius \u2013 for weeks at a time or even within a single shift. The Government proposals could also see nurses rostered to work shifts lasting four, six, eight, 10 or 12 hours. The INMO had seen the new contract as a potential opportunity to modernise nursing practices. However, it contended the Government proposals would actually worsen existing working arrangements. The proposals were rejected by both the INMO and Siptu. While Government representatives agreed to some changes in the proposals during direct talks with unions and at the Workplace Relations Commission, they insisted on retaining provision for the roster reforms and to move nurses between locations. This is the impasse that the Labour Court will seek to break this week. The question as to why the Government has insisted on such controversial changes which potentially could jeopardise an overall agreement has been debated widely in industrial relations circles in recent weeks. Some believe the Government\u2019s target in its contract proposals is not actually the nurses but rather the wider public service trade union movement. From the start of the process, the Government was determined a settlement to the nurses\u2019 dispute would not cause a breakdown in the existing public service accord, leading to a pay free-for-all across the State sector. However, the other public service unions have so far held off on launching their much-anticipated knock-on claims. But they have not gone away. They are watching developments very carefully to see how any eventual nurse settlement plays out. So what will the nurses have to give in productivity or work-practice changes in return for additional payments? Some senior industrial relations figures believe the Government is sending a message to the broader public service union movement that if strike action is taken by nurses, the Government and its social partners will not hesitate to strike back, or issue strike warnings or even to take industrial action themselves. The biggest fear is that the nurses\u2019 dispute will result in the Government pursuing a more general cost-cutting agenda which will undermine its public service commitments. The Department of Finance has already pointed out there will be no cost-saving measures in the proposed deal because the nurses are committed to covering the cost increase themselves. Minister for Social Protection, Regina Doherty, has said the cost of the deal is not excessive and the Government is expecting annual pay rises of up to 14 per cent for other public servants from 2021 onwards.

{"prefix": "The first freshman class selected to Florida's state college system since Gov. Jeb Bush put an end to race-based admissions has shown, instead of a decrease in minority enrollment, an increase of 12 percent.\nMr. Bush, whose plan allows the admission of the top 20 percent of graduating seniors from each state high school, whether predominantly black, white or Hispanic, said the increase was proof that diversity in other college systems could be accomplished without affirmative action.\n''The most diverse in history,'' Mr. Bush said of the incoming freshmen, who are the first students to be admitted without affirmative action mandates since racial set-asides were put in place in Florida in 1978.\nHe said his plan, called One Florida, produced an incoming class of more than 40 percent minorities -- blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans -- and could be a model for other states whose affirmative action laws are being challenged in the courts or at the polls.\nBut critics of the plan say it is far too soon, after one year, to call the plan a success. Some experts on education reform called the new system a gimmick that simply gives affirmative action a new name.\nMr. Bush dismissed the criticism as he celebrated what he said was a clear victory in a difficult social and political arena. Black leaders here had said the plan would cripple college admissions of blacks.\n''I've spent the last 10 months getting blistered by people who didn't believe we could do this,'' Mr. Bush said.\nUnlike in Texas and California, which have similar programs that produced initial drops in minority enrollment, ''we did not wait for a legal challenge or a ballot initiative,'' said Mr. Bush.\nTexas courts threw out affirmative action laws in 1996, but the state eventually restored its racial mix on college campuses under a plan in Texas under Gov.

Jeb Bush put an end to race-based admissions has shown, instead of a decrease in minority enrollment, an increase of 12 percent. Mr. Bush, whose plan allows the admission of the top 20 percent of graduating seniors from each state high school, whether predominantly black, white or Hispanic, said the increase was proof that diversity in other college systems could be accomplished without affirmative action. ''The most diverse in history,'' Mr. Bush said of the incoming freshmen, who are the first students to be admitted without affirmative action mandates since racial set-asides were put in place in Florida in 1978. He said his plan, called One Florida, produced an incoming class of more than 40 percent minorities -- blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans -- and could be a model for other states whose affirmative action laws are being challenged in the courts or at the polls. But critics of the plan say it is far too soon, after one year, to call the plan a success. Some experts on education reform called the new system a gimmick that simply gives affirmative action a new name. Mr. Bush dismissed the criticism as he celebrated what he said was a clear victory in a difficult social and political arena. Black leaders here had said the plan would cripple college admissions of blacks. ''I've spent the last 10 months getting blistered by people who didn't believe we could do this,'' Mr. Bush said. Unlike in Texas and California, which have similar programs that produced initial drops in minority enrollment, ''we did not wait for a legal challenge or a ballot initiative,'' said Mr. Bush. Texas courts threw out affirmative action laws in 1996, but the state eventually restored its racial mix on college campuses under a plan in Texas under Gov. George W. Bush that admitted the top 10 percent of students in each school. Jeb Bush said he used elements of the Texas plan in his own. But it was California's end to affirmative action, in a statewide vote in 1997, that may have forced the Florida governor's hand. Ward Connerly, a businessman and black conservative who led the battle to end affirmative action in California, had turned his attentions to Florida, and Mr. Bush's One Florida plan was seen as a way to blunt that looming battle in a year that his brother was running for president. Critics of the plan, who fought against it when Mr. Bush unveiled it in November, said it is too soon to claim victory, and said the affirmative action program he ended was already steadily improving minority enrollment. Mr. Bush said the Florida plan does something old affirmative action did not do: It allows students to pursue an education without the stigma of set-asides and lowered admission standards. ''Every student entering our system today can be proud of what we accomplished, and be confident that achievement, not skin color or ethnic background, is the only measure of merit in our universities,'' he said. Of the 3,202 incoming students, 1,234 were minorities, and all 10 colleges in the state system increased their enrollment of blacks, according to statistics from the university system. That increase of black enrollment was not just at predominantly black colleges, but also at Florida's two leading state-run universities -- the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and Florida State University, in Tallahassee. The number of enrolling black students at the University of Florida was up 33 percent from last year, and up 21 percent from last year at Florida State. The number of Hispanic students enrolling at the University of Florida grew by 19 percent, and by 24 percent at Florida State. The two leading universities enrolled 577 more black and Hispanic students this year than last year. In the past, universities had put in place a double standard for minorities, and quotas. ''Now everybody's in the pool,'' said Carmen Brown , a professor of public policy at Florida State.

Azoulay, 45, came from behind to defeat Hamad bin Abdulaziz Al-Kawari, also a former culture minister, after he failed to pick up support from other Gulf states which are part of a Saudi-led coalition blockading Qatar. The vote was 30 to 28. The campaign to succeed UNESCO's outgoing chief Irina Bokova was overshadowed by Washington's announcement Thursday that it planned to withdraw from the Paris-based body after years of tensions over decisions seen as critical of Israel. In the face of the Arab divisions, France presented Azoulay as a consensus figure who could mend fences and soothe tensions with Israel. \"In a time of crisis, we need more than ever to get involved (and) work to strengthen the organisation,\" Azoulay said after the final vote. Azoulay, who is Jewish of Moroccan origin, will face the difficult task of trying to persuade the United States and Israel to remain as members. Just as daunting will be her job of reforming the agency struggling under the weight of a bureaucracy that has become unwieldy over the seven decades since it was founded. French President Emmanuel Macron hailed her victory on Twitter, saying: \"France will continue to fight for science, education and culture in the world.\" Azoulay, who will become UNESCO's second woman leader after Bokova, had edged out Egyptian rights activist Moushira Khattab earlier Friday as the main challenger to Al-Kawari, the frontrunner until the final run-off. Azoulay's nomination must be approved by the agency's 195 member states on November 10, a vote that has never previously gone against the board's nominee. Arab states believed the job of director-general of the organisation should go to one of them for the first time, but regional rivalries and the US and Israeli withdrawals undercut their ambitions. Egypt threw its weight behind Azoulay after Khattab dropped out, a member of her delegation told AFP. Egypt is part of the coalition led by Saudi Arabia that has been blockading strategically placed Qatar since June over its alleged support for radical Islamists and its ties to Iran. Lebanon's candidate Vera El-Khoury, who bowed out at the fourth round of voting, told AFP that the power game at play in the race had shown UNESCO members \"did not give a damn\" about the candidates' programmes. Qatar has generously funded UNESCO in recent years and lobbied intensively for the post, which would have helped bolster its international status at a time when it faces isolation in the Gulf. Al-Kawari had also been dogged by old allegations of anti-Semitism after the Simon Wiesenthal Center accused him of remaining silent about anti-Semitic books at a fair in Doha when he was culture minister. UNESCO is best known for its World Heritage sites including tourist favourites such as the Grand Canyon or Cambodia's Angkor Wat, but it also to promotes human rights, democracy and the advancement of knowledge.

Those wishing to attend are asked to contact Marilyn Koren, director of development for GSE, by July 26 at (716) 645-2478, ext. 1029, or by email at mjkoren@buffalo.edu. Gordon earned bachelor's and master's degrees in string bass performance from the Eastman School of Music, Rochester, and played string bass with the Gene Krupa band before going on to earn a doctorate from the University of Iowa in 1958. He was a professor of music at Iowa before coming to UB. In recent years, he has been teaching a week-long workshop at UB on music learning theory. The workshop has evolved from a single-day seminar into a weeklong event that includes a reception and dinner. It is one of the last opportunities for a face-to-face gathering of his peers, former students and area music educators. His wife, Marilynn, will be in attendance, as will many of his former UB colleagues in the music department, many of whom continue to teach at UB. His most recent book, The Music Teacher's Guide to Audiation: A Practical Guide to Teaching Music Learning Theory, published by the Learning Sciences Division of the American Psychological Association, is the first book to describe the process by which the brain understands music and coined the term \"audiation.\" <sent> Gordon also contributed to the development of the A </sent>", "output": ["he has been teaching a week-long workshop at UB on music learning theory.

Images: from Lysergic World (April, 1993): Albert Hofmann in 1977 (above), and the route of his famous bicycle ride on LSD through Basel, Switzerland on April 19, 1943, from Sandoz Laboratories to his house. Below, Leary's archivist Michael Horowitz reminisces about a car ride with Albert Hofmann and Timothy Leary in February 1972. \"Tim and I took the train to Basel where Albert picked us up in his car. He drove, Tim sat in the passenger seat and me in back, trying to manage a super 8mm movie camera with one hand and a tape recorder with the other. Albert told us that we were driving the route of his first LSD trip in 1943, when he bicycled home with his Sandoz lab assistant after testing 250 micrograms. Tim cracked up when I asked Albert if he still had the bicycle. I knew it was gauche of me, but I couldn't resist. A short time later Albert pulled over.\" Here is an excerpt of the conversation between Albert and Tim, after they picked us up at the train station. On the way to Albert's estate we passed by his 1943 home. At Wired, Greg Miller writes about Timothy Leary's journey from scientist to \"psychedelic celebrity\", revealed in new detail by the release of his archives. Leary may be best known for his role in the psychedelic movement of the \u201960s, but in his later years, at the dawn of the internet age he became fascinated by the potential of technology to transform human communication (see the related gallery on video games and other software from Leary\u2019s archives). He also became interested in life extension and space migration, which he discussed in an exchange of letters with astronomer Carl Sagan. A previously unknown connection between Czech dissident Vaclav Havel and American psychologist Timothy Leary is revealed by an inscribed copy of Leary's 1977 Neuropolitics. Michael Horowitz*, Timothy Leary's longtime archivist, has permitted the Timothy Leary Archives website to publish a transcription of a tape recorded conversation between Dr. Leary and his wife Rosemary, and John Lennon and Yoko Ono, made during John and Yoko's Bed-In for Peace in Montreal, May 1969. Tim had given it to Michael, in 1984 when he visited Hofmann in Switzerland. * *This excerpt from the forthcoming film, based on Michael's recollections, was published here with his permission. After Albert had driven us back to Basel where we were staying, Tim and I had bought some food and drinks and had a little picnic, then spent the rest of the afternoon with his son, Carl. At one point Tim said that he wanted us to know that over the years Albert had sometimes been mean and dismissive to him. <sent> He told us about Albert's decision in 1964 to abandon the old house and move to the new one in Basel.

In breaking the sound barrier, Yeager becomes the fastest man alive \u2014 and the legend of the X-Planes begins.\nAs airplanes flew faster and faster throughout the 1930s, pilots began to experience a number of problems associated with the increased airspeed. Aircraft such as the Lockheed P-38 and Republic P-47 flew just fine at ordinary speeds in level flight. But if pilots put them in a high-speed dive, they began to experience control problems that led to the deaths of several pilots.\nThe main problem facing these pilots was the aerodynamic condition known as compressibility. Simply stated, at speeds well below the speed of sound, most of the air molecules have time to get out of the way of an aircraft as it approaches, and the density of the air does not change.\nHowever, as the speed of sound is approached, the air molecules can\u2019t get out of the way, and more of them hit the aircraft. The impact compresses the air in front of the aircraft and increases the air density. Eventually shock waves form around the airplane, affecting the lift and drag. These changes were not well-understood and led to the loss of control in several aircraft.\nBecause the effects of compressibility are directly related to the speed of sound, a ratio is used to describe the speed of an aircraft. The Mach number is the speed at which an object is traveling relative to the speed of sound at a particular temperature. The name is in honor of physicist Ernest Mach, who studied high-speed gas dynamics.\nThe Bell X-1 was developed to research aerodynamics in the transonic region, or speeds just below and just above the speed of sound. After numerous flights with civilian test pilots, Capt. Yeager of the newly formed U.S. Air Force made his first powered flight in the X-1 on Aug. 29, 1947, high over the Mojave Desert of southern California.\nThe problem Yeager was experiencing was the ineffectiveness of the X-1\u2019s pitch controls, as shock waves essentially created an aerodynamic shadow around the tail. Changes were made to the horizontal tail controls, allowing Yeager to control the airplane's ability to pitch up and down, and flights continued. This knowledge would lead to the all-flying tail, or stabilator, standard on all supersonic fighters today.\nYeager was nursing two broken ribs on the morning of Oct. 14, after being thrown from his horse on a ride the night before. He boarded the B-29 bomber that was to carry the Bell X-1 to altitude. The plan was to fly to Mach 0.97. But Yeager says the new moving tail boosted his morale, and he wanted to fly faster.\nAfter climbing down into the X-1, which was carried like a bomb in the belly of the B-29, Yeager\u2019s friend and fellow test pilot Jack Ridley handed him a short, sawed-off section of broomstick.

Smartphone case manufacturers such as Otterbox and chipset vendor Integrated Device Technology are among the new wave of companies backing the PMA, which was founded by Duracell's Powermat and its parent company Procter & Gamble and Powermat Technologies in March 2012. \"For wireless power to really transform our lives, a lot of things have to come together, from how companies make their products to public spaces deploying the right technology for charging,\" Daniel Schreiber, president of Powermat and Power Matters Alliance board member, told Mashable. \"We are becoming so dependent on our mobile devices, and people want longer battery life. We want to tackle that issue, but we need manufacturers and companies to get on the same page.\" With the most recent backing of Starbucks, Google and AT&T in October and existing support from Facebook, General Motors and Delta Airlines \u2014 which is already using wireless charging in its Sky Club lounges \u2014 more are looking to join in. In fact, after Starbucks announced it would introduce Duracell Powermat charging stations embedded into tables at 17 locations in Boston, PMA membership has skyrocketed, tripling in the past month alone. \"Eventually, we will reach a tipping point where it transforms from being cool to becoming an industry standard and expectation,\" Schreiber said. Madison Square Garden has also embraced PMA wireless charging stations, as well as various salons, restaurants and airports across the U.S. Among the new batch of companies joining include case makers Incipio and Skech, as well as APS Technologies, Diodes, Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Everpurse, Foxlink, IGRS China, Leyden Energy, Microsemi, Microtips Technology, Monolithic Power Systems, MxMedia, NXT health, NXP Semiconductors, ON e Charge, Omron, Panasonic, Qualcomm, and X10 Technologies. Existing members include the Wi-Fi Alliance, which represents wireless carriers such as Verizon, and payment services such as Mastercard and PayPass, which owns PayMoney. <sent> The PMA is also partnering with the Wireless Power Consortium, a group founded in 2010 whose mission is to work with both the public and private sectors to build a better, connected global wireless power platform.

So what exactly is he doing here? Is he declaring that he's - there's an impending missile strike? GREENE:...And, I mean, Trump was critical of President Obama's red line in Syria, I mean, suggesting it was crazy to draw a red line if you weren't sure that you were going to act. I mean, he's almost creating his own red line in a way. LIASSON: There's no doubt about it. As a matter of fact, almost exactly a year ago when he called for that limited missile strike against a Syrian airfield, at the time he said this shows that when I put a red line in the sand I really mean it and Obama didn't act. Well, it turns out that strike - that limited was about to take place in April of last year. And so the question now is what exactly does Trump mean by a much bigger strike and when might that strike take place? So we do know that the situation in Syria remains very tense. The Syrian government has carried out several big airstrikes in recent weeks.

But unlike at other conferences, where the flashing lights and neon colors that educators have come to expect emanate brightly from the stage, the mood was somber\u2014with keynote speaker Paul Saffo asking serious questions about the future of education and the role technology will play.\nAs attendees and exhibitors sat in their seats, sipping Seattle\u2019s trademark beverage, their eyes focused on the stage: Seattle\u2019s black skyline with hues of purple and blue, clouds massed on the horizon\u2014signaling rain clouds on the way.\nAccording to Saffo, there are some tips educators can use to predict the next big technological innovation that will directly affect the economy.\nFirst, take a look at history: In the 1950s, the key technological innovation was the television\u2014and the media expression of it was broadcasting in the 1960s. In the 1980s, it was the client server that led to the media expression of the World Wide Web of the 1990s. Earlier this decade, peer-to-peer file sharing and online social networks emerged, and perhaps in the next decade, sites like Twitter will be the definitive media expression.\n\u201cIf you look at these trends, technology makes the medium possible, but the \u2026 medium is not ubiquitous until the next big innovation comes along,\u201d explained Saffo. There is a trend of a decade\u2019s difference between the technology and the medium\u2014and most media will not be fully integrated until the next new technology is able to leverage the decade-old medium.\nSaffo listed examples, such as an avatar site called Habitat in the 1980s. Even though it was the same concept as we see today in sites such as Second Life\u2014the avatar moved around a virtual world, buying things and being able to talk to people\u2014the right platform just wasn\u2019t there, and it failed.\nAccording to Saffo, it wasn\u2019t until gaming became popular and gaming software improved that people got into virtual worlds. Thanks to new gaming technology, Second Life is now a huge success.\nAnother example", "gen_completion": " was the high-tech industry in the 1990s and 2000s\u2014think Internet in the 1990s and early 2000s when it became the norm to connect\u2014with video-sharing sites such as YouTube. Again, the right platform for content didn\u2019t emerge until the next new technology emerged or the content was accessible via video. While some sites now do have videos, the current ones are not at the level of YouTube.\nOther examples are the emergence of mobile phones\u2014think early cell telephones\u2014that the right platform was not available. The same could be said for some of the web sites that existed in the early 2000s. The most notable examples are Facebook and MySpace that weren\u2019t fully established until the next technology emerged.\nSome things simply don\u2019t work because they were not developed at the right time.

But unlike at other conferences, where the flashing lights and neon colors that educators have come to expect emanate brightly from the stage, the mood was somber\u2014with keynote speaker Paul Saffo asking serious questions about the future of education and the role technology will play. As attendees and exhibitors sat in their seats, sipping Seattle\u2019s trademark beverage, their eyes focused on the stage: Seattle\u2019s black skyline with hues of purple and blue, clouds massed on the horizon\u2014signaling rain clouds on the way. According to Saffo, there are some tips educators can use to predict the next big technological innovation that will directly affect the economy. First, take a look at history: In the 1950s, the key technological innovation was the television\u2014and the media expression of it was broadcasting in the 1960s. In the 1980s, it was the client server that led to the media expression of the World Wide Web of the 1990s. Earlier this decade, peer-to-peer file sharing and online social networks emerged, and perhaps in the next decade, sites like Twitter will be the definitive media expression. \u201cIf you look at these trends, technology makes the medium possible, but the \u2026 medium is not ubiquitous until the next big innovation comes along,\u201d explained Saffo. There is a trend of a decade\u2019s difference between the technology and the medium\u2014and most media will not be fully integrated until the next new technology is able to leverage the decade-old medium. Saffo listed examples, such as an avatar site called Habitat in the 1980s. Even though it was the same concept as we see today in sites such as Second Life\u2014the avatar moved around a virtual world, buying things and being able to talk to people\u2014the right platform just wasn\u2019t there, and it failed. According to Saffo, it wasn\u2019t until gaming became popular and gaming software improved that people got into virtual worlds. Thanks to new gaming technology, Second Life is now a huge success. Another example he gave was the high-tech industry in the 1990s and early 2000s. Then the World Wide Web became a universal platform\u2014but until it was combined with the next new platform, which was the video, it wasn\u2019t ubiquitous. Although many sites have videos, none have the popularity of YouTube. Likewise, he said, cell phones didn\u2019t really take off until there was a better platform, and the same thing happened with the early sites that were developed in the early 2000s.

Last week, two Yellowstone tourists spotted an abandoned bison calf by the road and decided to put it in their car and drive it to a park ranger. Bad move. The poor little guy had to be put down because its new scent prevented its herd from taking him back. Oh, and no selfies either. Bison injure more people in Yellowstone than any other animal, and last year, two selfie snappers got headbutted when they turned their backs on bison. Venturing into America\u2019s deserts can be an other-worldly adventure, but a sandy walk will quickly turn deadly if you\u2019re unprepared. Last summer, a family hike in New Mexico\u2019s White Sands National Monument turned tragic when a mother and father apparently died of heat exhaustion while attempting to keep their 9-year-old son hydrated with only two bottles of water (the child survived). Sweaty travelers might be enticed by a dip in the river, but they shouldn\u2019t underestimate the power of a current. In 2012, two young campers drowned after wading into the Merced River in Yosemite National Park. According to a Wonkblog analysis of National Park Service data, drowning is the leading cause of death in National Parks. Emergency rescuers responded not once, not twice, but three times to satellite tracker calls of one group of Grand Canyon backpackers in 2009 despite there being no real emergency. The first time, the hikers feared they ran out of water. Upon finding a water source they called again fearing the water tasted too salty. Finally, after calling a third time, a helicopter lifted them out of the canyon. Weather is often unpredictable in wild areas\u2014if storms are remotely in the forecast, don\u2019t risk it. When one group of canyoneers in Utah\u2019s Zion National Park left to belay down Keyhole Canyon, weather reports noted a moderate chance for flash flooding, but by the time that warning went up to probable, the group was out of cell phone range. The group was later found dead after drowning in the canyon. We\u2019ve all gotten the memo from Smokey the Bear, but some people just don\u2019t listen. Investigators tracked the origin of the devastating 2013 Rim Fire around Yosemite National Park to a hunter\u2019s illegal campfire. Four hundred square miles burned, adding up to $127 million of damage. Yes, the view is stunning, but if you\u2019re behind the wheel, pull over before taking it in. In 2014, the Blue Ridge Parkway in Shenandoah National Park was the scene of a horrific collision that killed two tourists, including an infant. The initial crash happened around 10:30 a.m., when a vehicle rammed into the back of another, toppling the car. A second collision killed two more pedestrians and injured two others. The Blue Ridge Parkway is America\u2019s most-traveled scenic byway, so we can\u2019t say it\u2019s a surprise these accidents happen. On a warm August day in 2015, hundreds of visitors arrived at the Grand Canyon only to find the park closed due to wildfires. The park did an excellent job of explaining what happened, but the damage caused by the fires was devastating for locals and tourists alike. <sent> The National Guard was brought in to help park officials contain the massive forest fires in Utah\u2019s Zion National Park when they reached the 2 million acre mark.

Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali said he had yet to be persuaded that a truly Islamic state could grant its citizens religious freedom. \"Very prominent church leaders have said in my presence that a truly Islamic state will guarantee the freedoms of non-Muslims. Well I beg to differ! I don't think there is a single historical instance of this happening anywhere,\" he said. The Bishop said countries in the Middle East must learn from the case of Egypt and look beyond the ideal of democracy. \"Democracy is not enough,\" he said. \"It can simply mean the feeling of the majority. In the Egyptian context, the question is not achieving power through the ballot box, but whether there is a willingness to give up power through the ballot box. That's the other test of democracy.\" Religious , he said, should be embedded in the nation state and only then can the individual be given religious freedom. \"The state in Iran, for instance, is no longer a state that is near and dear to the hearts of the people,\" he said. \"They allow this tiny minority of the Shia to meet in secret.

A vote on the proposed cuts, which include cross country, golf, tennis, wrestling, lacrosse and slow-pitch softball, will be June 13.\n\"Part of that is it's a little too early to tell what the impact is going to be... are they going to be able to put some of those back through the help of some outside organizations, it's a little too early,\" he said. \"We've been the fastest growing school district in the state the past four years (percentage-wise). Rapid growth and an influx of students is something we're used to.

On Wednesday, Fox recommended to the school board that cutting 10 varsity sports would save $445,298.\nThat could send students scrambling for private schools or into surrounding counties to continue their careers. In addition to the high school sports, junior varsity soccer and two undetermined middle school sports will also be purged. According to the Florida Times-Union, the high school cuts alone would eliminate sports that 2,054 athletes competed in during the 2010-11 year.\nFlorida High School Athletic Association executive director Roger Dearing said that if the situation in Duval County plays out as is being projected, students couldn't just pick up and leave a program because of a sport not being offered there anymore.\n\"We would not ease the transfer rules,\" said Dearing, referring to Article 9 in the FHSAA bylaws about which covers student eligibility.\n\"They can't put on their application that they want", "gen_completion": " to transfer and we'll let it go through.

As one of the fastest-growing school districts in the state, St. Johns County could very well find itself in position to absorb some of the spillover of the nearly 2,100 students who won't be able to compete in the sport that they did this past athletic season. St. Johns County School District Superintendent Joseph Joyner said that the county would have to address some of the residuals from the Duval County situation, although that it would wait until the decisions were finalized before doing so. A vote on the proposed cuts, which include cross country, golf, tennis, wrestling, lacrosse and slow-pitch softball, will be June 13. \"Part of that is it's a little too early to tell what the impact is going to be... are they going to be able to put some of those back through the help of some outside organizations, it's a little too early,\" he said. \"We've been the fastest growing school district in the state the past four years (percentage-wise). Rapid growth and an influx of students is something we're used to. That's not going to change.\" St. Johns County schools have increased their enrollment by an average of 922 students annually between 2007-2010, and that number could rise again if the scenario plays out in Duval County as it was presented this week. On Wednesday, Fox recommended to the school board that cutting 10 varsity sports would save $445,298. That could send students scrambling for private schools or into surrounding counties to continue their careers. In addition to the high school sports, junior varsity soccer and two undetermined middle school sports will also be purged. According to the Florida Times-Union, the high school cuts alone would eliminate sports that 2,054 athletes competed in during the 2010-11 year. Florida High School Athletic Association executive director Roger Dearing said that if the situation in Duval County plays out as is being projected, students couldn't just pick up and leave a program because of a sport not being offered there anymore. \"We would not ease the transfer rules,\" said Dearing, referring to Article 9 in the FHSAA bylaws about which covers student eligibility. \"They can't put on their application that they want a sport to be offered and we're going to let them in. We have to accept the transfer and then they can compete.\" Dearing estimated that the state would lose 10,000 student-athletes in the next school year, which could lead to the state needing to increase its budget by $40 million annually to address the need to replace the programs that will be lost. Fox would not reveal the exact number of student-athletes that the elimination of sports would affect in Duval County. \"It's something I can't do, for competitive reasons, but there's obviously going to be a reduction of student-athletes.... It's very possible that there would be an effect on the St. Johns County schools. \" <sent> The athletic budgets are in the middle of the whole budget process and I'm not going to speculate.\" He's </sent>", "output": ["a sport to be offered and we're going to let them in.

{"prefix": "It's a well-known fact that some of our favourite seafoods come with an unsavoury dose of heavy metals like mercury. But there's another group of chemicals that sometimes lace our tuna steaks, and the latest findings on them are anything but appetising. They're called persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and they do a bang-up job obstructing the human body's chemical defence system. That's according to an analysis published today in Science Advances, examining how ten POPs found in both tuna and human bodily fluids interact with a gatekeeper protein that shuttles unwanted toxins out of our cells. The findings suggest that ingesting even very small quantities of POPs can do bodily harm.\n\"These chemicals interfere with our chemical defence system's ability to operate, which can make us more vulnerable to drugs and other toxins,\" Amro Hamdoun, a biologist at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and lead author on the study, told Gizmodo.\nPOPs have been around for a long, long time. One of the most infamous, the pesticide DDT, was developed during World War II. DDT was banned in the 1970s, but other POPs, including flame retardants and non-stick coatings, are still widely used today. While these chemicals are damn useful in many applications, they're a toxicologist's nightmare. They degrade very slowly in the environment, they accumulate in biological tissues and they have been been linked to everything from impaired neural development to obesity.\nHamdoun's study sheds new light on POP toxicity by demonstrating, for the first time, exactly how these chemicals shut down a key cellular defence system. Normally, foreign molecules are kicked out of our cells by a special transporter known as P-glycoprotein (Pg-p). \"Pg-p is a bit like a bouncer,\" Hamdoun said. \"Initially, we thought that these chemicals sneak past the bouncer. But what we found is that they actually form very intimate interactions with Pg-p.\"\nLaboratory tests revealed that ten of the most widespread POPs all bind tightly to this protective protein, inhibiting its ability to do its job. Even at levels where POPs themselves pose no hazard, \"they're interfering with the very systems and pathways that have evolved to protect us,\" Amro said.\nLevels of POPs in the environment are on the decline. But the ocean is a big place, and industry leaves a long legacy. \"The bottom line is, there are still reservoirs of these in the ocean,\" Amro said. \"And we are still being exposed to them through the consumption of seafood.\"\nWhich types of seafood and which part of the ocean", "gen_completion": " pose the greatest risk?

We're now looking at the whole gambit, what happens when the environment and the food chain interact. We're also trying to find out how they get there and what the ramifications of that are.\"\nSo what does this discovery mean for us? Well, it's more than just you looking at the fish and deciding whether it's a good idea to eat them.

DDT was banned in the 1970s, but other POPs, including flame retardants and non-stick coatings, are still widely used today. While these chemicals are damn useful in many applications, they're a toxicologist's nightmare. They degrade very slowly in the environment, they accumulate in biological tissues and they have been been linked to everything from impaired neural development to obesity. Hamdoun's study sheds new light on POP toxicity by demonstrating, for the first time, exactly how these chemicals shut down a key cellular defence system. Normally, foreign molecules are kicked out of our cells by a special transporter known as P-glycoprotein (Pg-p). \"Pg-p is a bit like a bouncer,\" Hamdoun said. \"Initially, we thought that these chemicals sneak past the bouncer. But what we found is that they actually form very intimate interactions with Pg-p.\" Laboratory tests revealed that ten of the most widespread POPs all bind tightly to this protective protein, inhibiting its ability to do its job. Even at levels where POPs themselves pose no hazard, \"they're interfering with the very systems and pathways that have evolved to protect us,\" Amro said. Levels of POPs in the environment are on the decline. But the ocean is a big place, and industry leaves a long legacy. \"The bottom line is, there are still reservoirs of these in the ocean,\" Amro said. \"And we are still being exposed to them through the consumption of seafood.\" Which types of seafood and which part of the ocean do you need to avoid? The study isn't just about fish. Pg-p also functions in the human gut, where it's been found to compromise the functioning of another of our body's defence systems, the microbiome. These findings have implications for almost any marine creature. \"We already knew there was a lot of overlap between the POPs in the environment and those that are commonly ingested,\" Hamdoun said. \"Our study just adds to that list.\" We're now looking at the full scope of what happens when environment and food system come together. We're also trying to understand how they get there and what the consequences are for us.\" <sent> Well, it's more than just you looking at the fish and deciding whether it's a good idea to eat them. Hamdoun recommends that consumers stay vigilant about their seafood and check for POP levels. \"Be wary of the fish you choose \u2014 the ones with higher levels </sent>", "output": ["do you need to avoid?

Greenville businessman John Warren's outsider status \u2013 he's never held public office \u2013 earned him Betsy Baumgardner's vote Tuesday. Voters like Baumgardner propelled Warren into a runoff with McMaster, the top vote-getter by a large margin. Baumgardner said she was looking for someone \"new and different.\" \"I'm just tired of the old guard in Columbia,\" she said. \"Columbia's gone bad and I want to make a change.\" The crowded Republican primary field made it difficult for McMaster to win outright, a fact that worked to Warren's advantage. A late push of campaign ads might have helped Warren edge out third-place finisher Catherine Templeton. And Templeton's controversial television ad, where she pretended to shoot a rattlesnake, likely backfired. Kristen Vick, a Virginia native who now lives in Greenville, voted for Templeton because McMaster ran on an \"I'm with Trump\" platform. She cast her vote at Springfield Baptist Church on East McBee Avenue. After researching the candidates, she felt Templeton had the best shot against McMaster, who has been in South Carolina politics for decades. Warren will have his work cut out for him in the next two weeks. In a speech to supporters Tuesday, he challenged McMaster to \"come out of hiding\" and face him in three debates, saying he wants the governor to answer tough questions about what he plans to do if re-elected. McMaster, who skipped several debates leading up to the primary, shouldn't assume he is a shoo-in against a well-financed Warren. It's likely that the contest will get ugly, and Warren should prepare himself for incoming fire from both McMaster and Trump. As expected, far fewer voters cast Democratic ballots in the primary. Columbia attorney James Smith won enough votes to win the primary outright, besting Greenville native and Florence attorney Marguerite Willis, and Phil Noble, a technology consultant from Charleston. Gwendolyn Young cast her vote for Willis Tuesday, while expressing disappointment that the Democratic Party didn't do more to get voters out to the polls. \"We have a major political and social shift in our culture,\" she said, adding that it shouldn't be a foregone conclusion that Democrats aren't contenders in major races. In the hotly contested race for the 4th Congressional District seat now held by Trey Gowdy, runoffs will decide the Republican and Democratic candidates who will advance to the general election. Lee Bright , an insurance salesman from Bluffton, won the Republican primary over state Rep. Jeff Duncan, a Greenville Republican. If the two face off in November, it will be a rematch of the race in which Bright edged out Duncan in the special election. The candidates in the November rematch haven't yet announced their support of one another. In the Democratic primary, John Warren won enough votes to head off a runoff with Myrtle Beach state Rep. Dick Harpootlian. The November general election will determine whether Democratic candidate James Smith or Republican Robert Pittenger, the incumbent, will win.

An apartment complex property management company could offer concierge services to the renters. A vacation home rental company might decide to have personalized meet-and-greet upon check-in. Broadening the types of properties is an alternative way to increase profits. If your business handles short-term sub-leases for apartments, you could offer that same service for townhouses and condos. Property management companies generate revenues from the owners of the properties they manage and from the guests, renters or lessees who occupy the properties. Increasing rates to the owners when management contracts are up for renewal increases revenues and therefore profits. Keep in mind that current owners may decide to contract with someone else if the rate increase is too high. The rates generated from the guests or those who pay to occupy the properties also can be increased. Revenues are generated by the rate or fee for occupying the space times the number of spaces occupied. In the case of an apartment building where each apartment leases for $500 per month and 200 extra apartments are added, the owners will earn an additional $6,000 per month. Overbilling is a means of generating revenues from the owners. The way this works is that the number of apartments occupied by the property owner is much higher than the amount generated. For example, in a small apartment complex where each apartment leases for $500 per month, and the building has 80 apartments, each property owner charges his son or daughter $100 per month to use the apartment and then collects the other $50 from the occupants. If each apartment has eight occupants, each owner charges his tenant $50 per month. If each apartment has 80 occupants, each tenant pays $100 per month and the remaining occupants pay $50 per month. <sent> The owner who charges all 80 would be in the black.

{"prefix": "JACKSON, Ga. -- Georgia executed its ninth inmate this year on Tuesday night, putting to death a man convicted of killing his father-in-law more than a quarter century ago.\nWilliam Sallie, 50, was pronounced dead at 10:05 p.m. after a lethal injection at the state prison in Jackson.\nLawyers who sought to block William Sallie\u2019s execution said he should be granted a new trial because of alleged juror bias, but courts haven\u2019t properly considered that evidence because he missed a filing deadline by eight days at a time when he didn\u2019t have a lawyer, his lawyers said in court filings.\nGeorgia has put to death more people this year than any other state, including Texas with seven. There have been 68 men and one woman executed in Georgia since 1976, CBS affiliate WGCL reports.\nSallie was the 46th inmate put to death by lethal injection, according to officials.\nSallie was convicted of murder in the fatal shooting of John Lee Moore in March 1990. His first conviction and death sentence were overturned because his attorney had a conflict of interest.\nAt his second trial in 2001, a woman eventually chosen as a juror lied during jury selection and failed to disclose domestic violence, messy divorces and a child custody battle that were \u201cbizarrely similar\u201d to Sallie\u2019s case, his lawyers said. They add she later bragged to his attorneys\u2019 investigator that she persuaded her divided peers to vote unanimously for death.\nThe defense team made those arguments in a clemency petition to the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, urging it to act as a \u201cfail safe\u201d against a miscarriage of justice. But the board, the only authority in Georgia with power to commute a death sentence, declined to spare Sallie\u2019s life following a clemency hearing Monday.\nSallie\u2019s lawyers asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the scheduled execution, but it declined. They argued that the high court\u2019s ruling in a pending Texas case with ineffective counsel issues could remove the procedural bars that are keeping the lower federal courts from considering their juror-bias claims.\nAttorneys for the state have argued the Texas case isn\u2019t similar enough that its outcome would affect Sallie, particularly because that case doesn\u2019t involve a federal petition that wasn\u2019t filed on time. Furthermore, they argue, even if the issues were identical, the federal appeals court in Atlanta is bound by its own precedent - which doesn\u2019t allow such an extraordinary admission of the procedurally barred evidence - and not by the future possibility of new precedent from the Supreme Court.\nSallie\u2019s lawyers also have argued in a state court petition that carrying out his execution would violate his constitutional rights. Lawyers for the state rejected those claims and a court dismissed the petition. Sallie\u2019s lawyers appealed to the state Supreme Court, which on Tuesday declined to stop his scheduled execution. His lawyers appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court which also declined Tuesday evening to stop his execution.\nAt the time of the killing, Sallie\u2019s wife was living with her parents in rural south Georgia after having filed for divorce and after the two had fought bitterly over custody of their young son.\nAfter cutting his in-laws\u2019 phone lines and breaking into their house about 12", "gen_completion": ":30 a.m. March 21, 1990, Sallie shot his son\u2019s mother and killed his mother-in-law.\nBy 4:15 a.m., he\u2019d killed his mother-in-law. Sallie then fled by car to nearby Lawrence County, where he fired at an airsoft-operated machine gun and a handgun that belonged to a neighbor named Tommy Little, who was hunting rabbits in the woods.\nLittle saw Sallie shoot his mother-in-law in the head, and he pursued him. Sallie stopped the car and tried to flee by car, only to get back in and open fire again before losing control, speeding off and crashing.

William Sallie, 50, was pronounced dead at 10:05 p.m. after a lethal injection at the state prison in Jackson. Lawyers who sought to block William Sallie\u2019s execution said he should be granted a new trial because of alleged juror bias, but courts haven\u2019t properly considered that evidence because he missed a filing deadline by eight days at a time when he didn\u2019t have a lawyer, his lawyers said in court filings. Georgia has put to death more people this year than any other state, including Texas with seven. There have been 68 men and one woman executed in Georgia since 1976, CBS affiliate WGCL reports. Sallie was the 46th inmate put to death by lethal injection, according to officials. Sallie was convicted of murder in the fatal shooting of John Lee Moore in March 1990. His first conviction and death sentence were overturned because his attorney had a conflict of interest. At his second trial in 2001, a woman eventually chosen as a juror lied during jury selection and failed to disclose domestic violence, messy divorces and a child custody battle that were \u201cbizarrely similar\u201d to Sallie\u2019s case, his lawyers said. They add she later bragged to his attorneys\u2019 investigator that she persuaded her divided peers to vote unanimously for death. The defense team made those arguments in a clemency petition to the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, urging it to act as a \u201cfail safe\u201d against a miscarriage of justice. But the board, the only authority in Georgia with power to commute a death sentence, declined to spare Sallie\u2019s life following a clemency hearing Monday. Sallie\u2019s lawyers asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the scheduled execution, but it declined. They argued that the high court\u2019s ruling in a pending Texas case with ineffective counsel issues could remove the procedural bars that are keeping the lower federal courts from considering their juror-bias claims. Attorneys for the state have argued the Texas case isn\u2019t similar enough that its outcome would affect Sallie, particularly because that case doesn\u2019t involve a federal petition that wasn\u2019t filed on time. Furthermore, they argue, even if the issues were identical, the federal appeals court in Atlanta is bound by its own precedent - which doesn\u2019t allow such an extraordinary admission of the procedurally barred evidence - and not by the future possibility of new precedent from the Supreme Court. Sallie\u2019s lawyers also have argued in a state court petition that carrying out his execution would violate his constitutional rights. Lawyers for the state rejected those claims and a court dismissed the petition. Sallie\u2019s lawyers appealed to the state Supreme Court, which on Tuesday declined to stop his scheduled execution. His lawyers appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court which also declined Tuesday evening to stop his execution. At the time of the killing, Sallie\u2019s wife was living with her parents in rural south Georgia after having filed for divorce and after the two had fought bitterly over custody of their young son. After cutting his in-laws\u2019 phone lines and breaking into their house about 12 31 a.m. on March 21, Sallie shot and killed his wife, who escaped, and then his father-in-law. Sallie fled to neighboring counties and later fired on a friend, Tommy Little, who was hunting rabbits. Sallie then tried to carjack Moore, but Little returned fire, striking the man in the chest.

Otto frets that money will change their friendship, and he\u2019s right. There is talk of Super PACs, the sub-prime mortgage collapse, the Sinaloa Cartel, ponzi schemes, the Koch brothers. The idea that friends shouldn\u2019t discuss money comes up more than once. Lazy Fair is a relatively short play overstuffed with ideas. Though Reyna, a gifted theater artist, writes good dialogue, the beginning of the play is so deliberately puzzling that the audience takes too long to get invested in the characters and story. Since Reyna is also acting in the play, Lazy Fair might have benefitted (as so many first productions do) from having someone come in and shave a little time off the script. Also, some of the lines come out a bit muddled.

{"prefix": "Amid declining budgets and increasing priorities, Yale\u2019s library system has begun to deepen partnerships with peer institutions to address upcoming challenges.\nAs the University prepares for the arrival of 800 more students over the next four years, ensuring that students continue to have positive experiences at Yale\u2019s libraries is an immediate concern for University Librarian Susan Gibbons.\n\u201cWith the new colleges coming on line, we are going to need new staffing to support 800 additional students,\u201d Gibbons said, adding that more librarians will be needed to help with undergraduate outreach programs and in majors where students have senior theses. Gibbons also estimated that with the coming increase in the University\u2019s undergraduate student body, the library will need to spend an additional $1.2 million for electronic content licenses annually.\nThe challenges are exacerbated by the library\u2019s funding structure. According to Gibbons, about three-quarters of the libraries\u2019 budget comes from the return on over 600 library-specific endowments that are managed by the University Investments Office, with the rest coming from general appropriations provided by the Office of the Provost.\nSince the money coming from the endowment is designated for purposes that can be fairly narrow \u2014 such as a gift specifically for adding books written in shorthand or adding materials related to seafaring adventures \u2014 many of the library\u2019s new initiatives can only be funded by what amounts to a quarter of its budget, Gibbons said.\nAs a result of its reliance on returns from the endowment, the library is more susceptible to fluctuations in market performance than the University at large, whose overall spending from the endowment accounts for a third of its total annual revenue.\nConsequently, the library is especially hurt by cases of major disruptions such as the 2008 financial crisis. Data submitted to the Association of Research Libraries indicates that Yale\u2019s total annual library expenditure had decreased by over $10 million \u2014 nearly 15 percent of its total budget \u2014 between 2005 and 2015.\nGibbons also noted that between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2011, the general appropriations portion of the library\u2019s budget was reduced by about 30 percent. ARL statistics show a decrease in the library\u2019s staffing by nearly 100 members between 2009 and 2010.\nFor Gibbons and other librarians, collaboration nowadays has become a much more active process beyond the adoption of best practices at other libraries. In fact, librarians across different universities interviewed said collaboration is now an integral part of how research libraries operate today.\nHarvard University Librarian Sarah Thomas expressed a similar sentiment, noting that while the 2008 crisis has created challenges, the downturn motivated libraries to pursue innovative approaches to accessing and using information.\nLibrarians interviewed cited the significant expansion of the BorrowDirect service \u2014 an intercollegiate system that allows students from participating schools to borrow library resources from other institutions \u2014 as an example of the increase in collaboration among research libraries.\nThe idea of a service like BorrowDirect was first discussed in the early 1990s with support from senior librarians at Yale, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania, according to BorrowDirect\u2019s website. Since its initial launch in 1999, the service has expanded to encompass the entire Ivy League and four other institutions: MIT, Duke,", "gen_completion": " the University of California-Irvine and Wisconsin. The program\u2019s budget increased by about 25 percent year-over-year between 2009 and 2014.\nThomas also cited collaboration as a primary way to help students and faculty meet their library needs in undergraduates, noting that not only is the library\u2019s online catalog a convenient way for students to find and access ebooks they might need, but the library\u2019s extension team has built community outreach programs that allow students to get to know each other through reading books or attending events together.\n\u201cThe idea that students are going to make these connections,\u201d Thomas said, \u201cand that if they\u2019re lucky, they\u2019ll get to meet other scholars and editors at their own campus\u201d is what\u2019s made collaboration so powerful.\nIn addition to the library\u2019s online efforts, the library has expanded its support of the student communities in different ways.

Data submitted to the Association of Research Libraries indicates that Yale\u2019s total annual library expenditure had decreased by over $10 million \u2014 nearly 15 percent of its total budget \u2014 between 2005 and 2015. Gibbons also noted that between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2011, the general appropriations portion of the library\u2019s budget was reduced by about 30 percent. ARL statistics show a decrease in the library\u2019s staffing by nearly 100 members between 2009 and 2010. For Gibbons and other librarians, collaboration nowadays has become a much more active process beyond the adoption of best practices at other libraries. In fact, librarians across different universities interviewed said collaboration is now an integral part of how research libraries operate today. Harvard University Librarian Sarah Thomas expressed a similar sentiment, noting that while the 2008 crisis has created challenges, the downturn motivated libraries to pursue innovative approaches to accessing and using information. Librarians interviewed cited the significant expansion of the BorrowDirect service \u2014 an intercollegiate system that allows students from participating schools to borrow library resources from other institutions \u2014 as an example of the increase in collaboration among research libraries. The idea of a service like BorrowDirect was first discussed in the early 1990s with support from senior librarians at Yale, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania, according to BorrowDirect\u2019s website. Since its initial launch in 1999, the service has expanded to encompass the entire Ivy League and four other institutions: MIT, Duke, UCI and the University of Wisconsin. The service\u2019s budget increased on average by 25 percent annually between 2009 and 2014. Thomas said that collaboration between the libraries is key to helping students and faculty meet their library needs, as the library\u2019s online catalog provides students with convenient access to books they need and the library\u2019s extension services help students get to know each other through common reading or attending events. <sent> \u201cThe idea that students are going to make these connections,\u201d Thomas said, \u201cand that if they\u2019re lucky, they\u2019ll get to meet other scholars and editors at their own campus\u201d is what\u2019s made collaboration so powerful.

General manager Brian Cashman and his front office have been among Britton\u2019s top choices all winter. And at the Winter Meetings, Cashman met with Ottavino\u2019s agent. They have two spots in the bullpen open. Come the trade deadline last season, both were filled with top notch arms \u2014 Robertson and Britton. It\u2019s unclear if Cashman will aim high for both spots, but it seems likely he\u2019ll spend on at least one, considering the Yankees\u2019 penchant for a super bullpen the last couple of years. Find out soon? Would think that there might be the proverbial rush on relievers now. With Robertson off the board, there\u2019s no reason to think things won\u2019t soon wrap up for Britton and Ottavino. Reminders: The 33-year-old Britton is under team control through the 2020 season. A trade request is certainly possible, but it seems likely that he\u2019ll settle on a one-year deal for now. He\u2019s been close with Cashman since coming over from the Rays in a mid-June deal. ... The left-hander has been in the postseason three times with the Yankees, including two World Series....

Bijou St.\nFree; for more information, call 578-8847 or write to comics@escapevelocity-comics.com.\nPropped against a wire book holder, a fairly flimsy black-and-white booklet called Velvet Garden, faced the throngs at last spring's GalaxyFest. The booklet sat at Ryan Davis' vendor table, and enough people bought his pitch \u2014 and the \"rough\" of his new comic \u2014 to fund a limited run of a full-color glossy version.\nIn June, at the 2012 Denver Comic Con, he made more than 100 sales, enough to publish the next issue.\nDavis is a 30-year-old with a dream: He wants to break into the big time in the comic book industry. He and his partner, Colorado Springs artist Gunther Goltz, have come up with what they hope will be a winning story that will catch the attention of big names.\n\"There are basically two ways of breaking into the business,\" says Steven Seagle, the Colorado Springs-bred co-founder of Man of Action Studios (creators of Cartoon Network's Ben 10), supervising producer for Disney XD's Ultimate Spider-man series, and veteran comic book writer for both DC and Marvel Comics. \"You can either produce your own comic, or you can know someone in the business.\n\"If you produce your own comic,\" he advises, \"do it from top to bottom. Find a way to get it out to the world. Self-publish it. This is your calling card.\"\nVelvet Garden is based on a 1980s urban legend about a psychoactive video game machine called Polybius, released by the U.S. government as an experiment in mind control. Davis and Goltz will officially unveil the second issue Saturday, Aug. 25, at Escape Velocity, the comics-and-graphic-novels store where they both work. But they've been selling and giving out samples for several weeks.\nWith Velvet Garden, they're actually debuting the three-volume, 18-issue series with Volume No. 2. Davis, who wrote the story, and Goltz, the illustrator, decided that it would showcase the story line better than the first volume, a prequel that goes into the game's background.\n\"In the first issue, the reader learns about Hitler's experiments with mind control, and some of the machines he built, but we didn't want readers to think the series was a World War II story, because it's not,\" Davis says. \"So, we went with the second volume, which takes place in the '80s.\"\nThe first (chronologically) of the three-volume set is called Wicked Garden, and the last, which is set in Colorado Springs, is titled Neon Garden. All three will eventually be made into distinct graphic novels, each made up of six serialized comic books.\nThough he's been in the business for a decade, Davis has worked with the single focus of breaking into the industry for about a year.

Propped against a wire book holder, a fairly flimsy black-and-white booklet called Velvet Garden, faced the throngs at last spring's GalaxyFest. The booklet sat at Ryan Davis' vendor table, and enough people bought his pitch \u2014 and the \"rough\" of his new comic \u2014 to fund a limited run of a full-color glossy version. In June, at the 2012 Denver Comic Con, he made more than 100 sales, enough to publish the next issue. Davis is a 30-year-old with a dream: He wants to break into the big time in the comic book industry. He and his partner, Colorado Springs artist Gunther Goltz, have come up with what they hope will be a winning story that will catch the attention of big names. \"There are basically two ways of breaking into the business,\" says Steven Seagle, the Colorado Springs-bred co-founder of Man of Action Studios (creators of Cartoon Network's Ben 10), supervising producer for Disney XD's Ultimate Spider-man series, and veteran comic book writer for both DC and Marvel Comics. \"You can either produce your own comic, or you can know someone in the business. \"If you produce your own comic,\" he advises, \"do it from top to bottom. Find a way to get it out to the world. Self-publish it. This is your calling card.\" Velvet Garden is based on a 1980s urban legend about a psychoactive video game machine called Polybius, released by the U.S. government as an experiment in mind control. Davis and Goltz will officially unveil the second issue Saturday, Aug. 25, at Escape Velocity, the comics-and-graphic-novels store where they both work. But they've been selling and giving out samples for several weeks. With Velvet Garden, they're actually debuting the three-volume, 18-issue series with Volume No. 2. Davis, who wrote the story, and Goltz, the illustrator, decided that it would showcase the story line better than the first volume, a prequel that goes into the game's background. \"In the first issue, the reader learns about Hitler's experiments with mind control, and some of the machines he built, but we didn't want readers to think the series was a World War II story, because it's not,\" Davis says. \"So, we went with the second volume, which takes place in the '80s.\" The first (chronologically) of the three-volume set is called Wicked Garden, and the last, which is set in Colorado Springs, is titled Neon Garden. All three will eventually be made into distinct graphic novels, each made up of six serialized comic books. Though he's been in the business for a decade, Davis has worked with the single focus of breaking into the industry for about a year. That started with co-creating a publishing company called Ruby Carriage, through which he produced several Internet-based comics before this current endeavor. Having a central location or imprint where people can find all his work makes things easier, but doesn't cover all the bases. Seagle says most comic fans still want something they can hold, and publishers want to see good-quality artwork. \"The quality has got to be great. It has to be the same as, say, your favorite comic, but in an original voice only you can provide... It takes a very talented person to produce something like that.\" That's why he believes in letting creators like Davis produce their own work and take it to a larger audience. The owners of Escape Velocity hope their shop's appeal is enough to help them break even, and, they say, they're proving it every day. The store opened six years ago and is \"just now breaking even,\" says John Clamp, sales and marketing manager.

A recent survey by Wells Fargo & Co. reports that 25 percent of the respondents said they'll need to work until at least age 80 because they will not have enough money to retire. Living with such a reality makes it hard to accept that the retirements funded with taxes can begin 10 years earlier than the age at which people are eligible for Social Security. But much more remains to be done. One area in desperate need of attention is the limit imposed on public employees' cost-of-living increases. The Massachusetts Retirement Law, which is our state's version of the federal government's so-called \"pension protection act,\" makes employees pay for their own pension increases, regardless of whether they are paid. The result is that many public employees, especially those with families, must work long past their planned retirement age because they would otherwise end up in poverty trying to make up a shortfall that they cannot afford. Another aspect of the system that needs fixing is the formula for determining how much the state pays for pensions that are fully earned but not yet earned. With the cap in place, an increasing number of state employees can expect to make up that shortfall in one lump sum. <sent> By paying retirees for benefits they no longer receive, state retirement funding is undermined and it makes it more difficult for people to sell their houses if and when their paychecks stop coming in.

Mixson is charged with the fatal Friday shooting of 21-year-old Darius Dashawn Redmon. Redmon died Saturday.\nThis development ends the weekend hunt for a suspect police considered armed and dangerous. Mixson is currently being held at Hudson County jail on $1 million bail.\nThis is not the felon's first run-in with the law. Mixson is a reputed member of the 52 Hoover Street Gangsta Crips in Jersey City, whose previous offenses include running over a 6-year-old boy and dragging him for over 70 feet before fleeing the scene in July 2008.\nAfter being in an induced coma for several weeks, the young boy, Jabari Cooley, miraculously survived.

Daquan Mixson, accompanied by his attorney, turned himself in last night at about 8 p.m., Hudson County Assistant Prosecutor Gene Rubino said. Mixson is charged with the fatal Friday shooting of 21-year-old Darius Dashawn Redmon. Redmon died Saturday. This development ends the weekend hunt for a suspect police considered armed and dangerous. Mixson is currently being held at Hudson County jail on $1 million bail. This is not the felon's first run-in with the law. Mixson is a reputed member of the 52 Hoover Street Gangsta Crips in Jersey City, whose previous offenses include running over a 6-year-old boy and dragging him for over 70 feet before fleeing the scene in July 2008.

{"prefix": "Believe it or not, a household pulling in over $130,000 can still avoid the tax!\nThis may help ease your tax burden when it comes to capital gains.\nAs tax season winds itself to a close, many American families have had to fork over a pretty penny for selling investments. Of course, this doesn't necessarily apply to tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but there are still a lot of families that have side money invested in the stock market for non-retirement purposes.\nToday, I'm going to tell you how many -- most, actually -- American families could sell their stock investments for a gain and not owe Uncle Sam a penny.\nFor starters, you absolutely must own the stocks you are going to sell for at least a year. Once you get beyond 365 days, your investment is considered a \"long term\" one, and that opens it to a host of tax advantages. If you follow the buy-to-hold investment philosophy that we preach here at The Motley Fool, this shouldn't be too hard.\nNext, let's take a look at how those long-term capital gains are taxed by the federal government.\nSource: Author's illustration, with information provided by the IRS.\nIf your household falls under the 10% or 15% tax bracket, then you can sell your investments -- up until they bump you into a new tax bracket -- and pay absolutely no taxes whatsoever!\nWhat do those tax brackets look like? According to The Tax Foundation, this is what the upper limit of the 15% bracket will look like.\nBut aren't these the exceedingly poor households?\nThat's a fair question. On the surface, it would appear that only those who are poor would qualify for this break. Once you scratch the surface, however, a different picture appears.\nFor starters, here's the breakdown of the average American household, via data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nSo if we assume that the average household is a married couple, and we don't take any deductions whatsoever (which would never happen), the average American household could still sell stocks and net gains of over $8,000 ($75,300-$66,877) without ever having to turn over a dime for those gains.\nTo really get an idea of how possible this is, let's look at the extreme end of the spectrum: a family of four that earns $135,000 before taxes. This is the type of demographic that even naysayers would agree could probably be making such investments -- meaning they have enough money left over to invest.\nAgain, on the surface, it would seem absurd that this family could possibly avoid capital gains taxes. But let's take a look at four very simple deductions that the family", "gen_completion": " can take to make sure they don't have to pay taxes at all.\nLet's say they qualify for a tax credit worth up to $600, which makes them eligible to claim the tax break. Even though the family is making well under the $135,000 threshold, they still pay very little in taxes because they aren't taking any deductions.\nNow that they've already taken the state and local tax deductions, the family will be able to claim another credit worth up to $400. If they're over the $135,000 threshold, they won't face capital gains taxes at all!\nOn top of that, the family only has $3,870 in taxes to pay! This is less than the gross household tax total of $35,980 (more when you add up all deductions), and it also happens to be well below the minimum for an IRA.\nSo how about you?

Today, I'm going to tell you how many -- most, actually -- American families could sell their stock investments for a gain and not owe Uncle Sam a penny. For starters, you absolutely must own the stocks you are going to sell for at least a year. Once you get beyond 365 days, your investment is considered a \"long term\" one, and that opens it to a host of tax advantages. If you follow the buy-to-hold investment philosophy that we preach here at The Motley Fool, this shouldn't be too hard. Next, let's take a look at how those long-term capital gains are taxed by the federal government. Source: Author's illustration, with information provided by the IRS. If your household falls under the 10% or 15% tax bracket, then you can sell your investments -- up until they bump you into a new tax bracket -- and pay absolutely no taxes whatsoever! What do those tax brackets look like? According to The Tax Foundation, this is what the upper limit of the 15% bracket will look like. But aren't these the exceedingly poor households? That's a fair question. On the surface, it would appear that only those who are poor would qualify for this break. Once you scratch the surface, however, a different picture appears. For starters, here's the breakdown of the average American household, via data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So if we assume that the average household is a married couple, and we don't take any deductions whatsoever (which would never happen), the average American household could still sell stocks and net gains of over $8,000 ($75,300-$66,877) without ever having to turn over a dime for those gains. To really get an idea of how possible this is, let's look at the extreme end of the spectrum: a family of four that earns $135,000 before taxes. This is the type of demographic that even naysayers would agree could probably be making such investments -- meaning they have enough money left over to invest. Again, on the surface, it would seem absurd that this family could possibly avoid capital gains taxes. But let's take a look at four very simple deductions that the family to make sure that they don't have to pay taxes at all. First, they could claim the earned income tax credit, which comes with a $600 tax break. Second, they could claim the child credit, which comes with a $3,000 tax break. Third, they could take the health care credit, which comes with a $1,050 tax break. Fourth, they could deduct state and local taxes, which comes with another $4,000 tax break. Even if they made over $135,000, they wouldn't owe any capital gains taxes, and they would owe only $3,870 in taxes! <sent> This is less than the gross household tax total of $35,980 (more when you add up all deductions), and it also happens to be well below the minimum for an IRA. So how about you? How many American households could sell their stocks to avoid paying any federal taxes at all? </sent>", "output": ["to make sure that they don't have to pay taxes at all.

He said Natas will launch a talent development platform by the end of next year, which will connect job seekers and travel agents. Giving an update of the Travel Agent Roadmap, Ms Sim said more than 40 projects were funded by STB's business improvement fund (BIF) and experience step-up fund, both aimed at making travel agents designers of travel experiences. Both funds financially support up to 70 per cent of projects that cost up to $500,000. Ms Sim added that five times as many travel agents were supported by either fund this year compared with last year, and encouraged more agents to apply. >40 Number of projects funded by STB's business improvement fund and experience step-up fund, both aimed at making travel agents designers of travel experiences. She cited Dynasty Travel, which is developing a mobile app with the BIF's help. The app will help customers make bookings, write reviews and contact the firm in emergencies, which will help it to tailor travel experiences and build customer loyalty. The road map, initiated in August last year, aims to boost the travel agent industry via technology, business transformation and manpower. Another firm benefiting from the drive to adopt technology is Quotient Travel Planner, which is creating a chatbot with tech firm Zumata for customers to access its services whenever they need them. Its co-founder and director Lim Hui Juan said: Tech can help with a traveller's journey, and she is excited to be able to integrate voice-assisted devices such as Amazon's Echo.

When it comes to high-end weapons, there's a new company in town that's changing the way people think about rifles. Founded in 2010, Proof Research of Kalispell specializes in creating lightweight, accurate weapons using carbon-fiber barrels and stocks unlike anything else on the market. While Proof Research may only be two years old, it is made up of four companies that have years of rifle-making experience, according to Rainey. Proof is actually a merger of Lone Wolf Riflestocks of Kalispell, Jense Fabrication of Missoula, ABS out of Lincoln, Neb., and Lawrence Rifle Barrels of Lewistown. Although only one of the core companies was from the Kalispell area, lead investor Mike Goguen said it made sense to locate Proof in the Flathead Valley. Goguen said he became involved in Proof while looking for a lightweight hunting rifle, and got more than he bargained for when his custom rifle was finished. In addition to folding several manufacturers under the Proof umbrella, Goguen said the company still contracts out certain parts, such as trigger assembly and receivers, to local companies such as Defiance Machine. With the four founding companies coming together to form Proof, the company needed a home in the Flathead. A new, state-of-the-art manufacturing, research and design facility was built on U.S. 2 between Kalispell and Columbia Falls. The grand opening was held Nov. 16. Although the company had been producing weapons and courting larger contracts for the two years since its founding, Rainey said the owners and investors were very careful about making sure the business was strong before opening its doors to the public. Currently Proof employs 29 employees, and Rainey said the company still is hiring. Goguen said there is great potential for job growth. \u201cIt's a slow, measured growth that we're aiming for; we've got a tight budget and we have faced challenges every single day, but we're overcoming them,\u201d Rainey said. The barrels Proof manufactures are not completely made of carbon fiber, rather they are traditional steel cores, machined down and wrapped with carbon fibers. According to Rainey, this results in a lighter-weight, more effective barrel of the same or similar overall dimensions and strength as more traditional all-steel barrels. Although the technology for carbon-fiber barrels may have been around for the last 20 years, the big problem to overcome was failure due to heat. In a typical rifle, the heat of extended firing will cause the barrel to warp slightly, and this can lead to a \u201cfairly large\u201d dispersion pattern. This means that what started out as shots in a dime-sized grouping on a target can expand to shots that could completely miss the point of aim. In some weapons, like the fully automatic M249 squad automatic weapon used by the military, the heat is so detrimental that multiple barrels are carried to prevent jams and increase accuracy. When carbon-fiber barrels first came on the scene, the heat dispersion was not much better than that of a standard steel barrel, and it wasn't until recently that the problem was solved by Advanced Barrel Systems. \u201cHeat causes failure, and failure causes death, and we want to prevent that,\u201d Goguen said. Many of the weapons Proof produces are for military and peacekeeping operations where accuracy matters most. The other big benefit to carbon-fiber barrels and stocks is a significant weight reduction. Rainey said that weight reduction can be very significant, whether it is for a soldier in the field or a hunter out for the weekend. In addition to its rifle barrels and stocks, Proof makes carbines and handguns that feature the same carbon-fiber barrels and stocks. Although Proof is primarily a rifle manufacturer, it also produces handguns for home defense and concealed carry.

Thurston, who made a cameo appearance at this year\u2019s tournament in the Beko Legends Big Kick competition, said he could not wait to take the field alongside his Cowboys teammates in 2017. \u201cI had a small taste of the NRL Nines this year, and the atmosphere was simply incredible,\u201d Thurston said. \u201cI made up my mind right away that I would be back to play in the 2017 tournament \u2013 and hopefully lead the Cowboys to another Nines title. North Queensland Cowboys coach Paul Green and General Manager Peter Parr confirmed his club would welcome the presence of its premier player and captain. \u201cEvery year he\u2019s always put pressure on me, being that attacking style suits his game and I think he\u2019d really flourish. \u201cWinning the inaugural tournament, I think the tournament holds a pretty special place in the club\u2019s history,\u201d Green said. Cowboys General Manager Peter Parr explains, \u201cThe main reason we\u2019ve decided to let Johnathan play is that he wants to play. \u201cHe\u2019s achieved a lot in the game, he\u2019s achieved more than most players have in the game but the one thing he hasn\u2019t done is play in this tournament, and he\u2019s very keen to play so we\u2019ve decided to let him do it,\u201d Parr said. \u201cEveryone will want to turn up and watch Jonathan Thurston play. I sat with him the whole tournament last year, we sat together and watched it and he was so enthusiastic about it and wanted to be a part of it so it goes to show how big the tournament is, the biggest drawcard in rugby league is going to be there putting his skills on.\u201d Johns said. The second premier player to confirm he will be playing in the 2017 tournament - Shaun Johnson - who led the Warriors to the 2016 final with a spectacular individual effort, said that coming so close had made him even more determined to claim an NRL Auckland Nines title for the host club. \"Making it to the final this year in front of our home fans was an awesome buzz,\" Johnson said. \"Obviously it was a real let down not to go the whole way, but we are determined to go one better in 2017. That won't be easy when you look at the talent the other clubs have on offer. I'll admit I'm excited to see JT play he\u2019ll put on a show.\" Martin Snedden, the chief executive of Downer NRL Nines promoters Duco Events, said the presence of the glamour pair in 2017 would add to an already impressive list of star players who have graced the event. \u201cOver its 14-year history, the Nines has produced an incredible 16 players who have been crowned NRL player of the tournament,\u201d Snedden said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also been a great opportunity for NRL clubs to showcase their players to the local New Zealand market.

{"prefix": "While the political ramifications of dependence on Russian natural gas are a current topic of debate within the European Union, often the talk fails to address a much larger issue of whether or not the importing of Russia\u2019s natural gas will help to meet the EU\u2019s growing demands.\nSo argues physicist Bengt S\u00f6derbergh, who recently completed a dissertation on an assessment of future Norwegian and Russian gas export levels.\nAccording to forecasts by the International Energy Agency (IEA), production of natural gas within the EU will decline from the 2006 level of 216 billion cubic metres per year (Gm3/year) to 90 Gm3/year by 2030, even as demand for gas is expected to rise significantly. The need to import gas will accordingly increase by up to 90 per cent during the period. Russia and Norway are currently the most significant suppliers of gas to the EU. Their combined share of the EU\u2019s gas imports during 2006 was 62 per cent.\nAs part of S\u00f6derbergh\u2019s analysis with regard to the future levels of Norwegian and Russian gas exports to the EU, Norwegian and Russian gas production scenarios were developed based on modelling of production from individual gas fields. As a result, the combined production from the largest fields \u2013 the so-called \u201cgiant fields\u201d \u2013 was forecast.\nEU energy security is significantly dependent on production from a relatively small number of Norwegian and Russian fields. Almost all of Norway\u2019s production derives from 18 large fields, 9 of which are classifiable as giant fields.\nEssentially all of Russia\u2019s production derives from 36 giant fields.\nThe findings show that there is little potential for an increase in the level of Norwegian gas exports to the EU. All of the scenarios studied indicate that Norwegian gas production will be in decline by 2030, by which year Norwegian gas deliveries to the EU via pipeline may have fallen by as much as 20 per cent from today\u2019s level.\nAdditionally, a study of potential production from Russian giant fields indicates a maximum increase of 45 per cent in the level of Russian gas exports to the EU by 2030. In absolute terms, this corresponds to approximately 70", "gen_completion": " Tm3/year in 2025\u20132030. The volume of Russian gas exports to the EU in 2025 will be approximately 30 per cent higher than in 2006, of which 60 per cent will come via pipeline. The amount of Russian energy delivered via pipeline will also increase significantly during the period from 2010 to 2030. In absolute terms, gas volumes delivered via pipeline will increase by more than 100 per cent during the period.\nHowever, the results show that the amounts and quality of the Russian exports to the EU will have no major impact on any of the scenarios studied. On the contrary, it has been shown that, for very large natural gas field owners, increased volumes and quality of the shipments to the EU has resulted in higher prices and new demand.\nHowever, the study shows that the level of Russian gas imports to the EU will remain a major issue for the EU. The study shows that both the Norwegian and Russian gas exports to the EU increase significantly when Russian gas volumes to the EU are", "paraphrase_outputs": {"lex_40_order_100": {"final_input": "lexical = 40, order = 100 While the political ramifications of dependence on Russian natural gas are a current topic of debate within the European Union, often the talk fails to address a much larger issue of whether or not the importing of Russia\u2019s natural gas will help to meet the EU\u2019s growing demands. So argues physicist Bengt S\u00f6derbergh, who recently completed a dissertation on an assessment of future Norwegian and Russian gas export levels. According to forecasts by the International Energy Agency (IEA), production of natural gas within the EU will decline from the 2006 level of 216 billion cubic metres per year (Gm3/year) to 90 Gm3/year by 2030, even as demand for gas is expected to rise significantly. The need to import gas will accordingly increase by up to 90 per cent during the period. Russia and Norway are currently the most significant suppliers of gas to the EU. Their combined share of the EU\u2019s gas imports during 2006 was 62 per cent. As part of S\u00f6derbergh\u2019s analysis with regard to the future levels of Norwegian and Russian gas exports to the EU, Norwegian and Russian gas production scenarios were developed based on modelling of production from individual gas fields. As a result, the combined production from the largest fields \u2013 the so-called \u201cgiant fields\u201d \u2013 was forecast. EU energy security is significantly dependent on production from a relatively small number of Norwegian and Russian fields. Almost all of Norway\u2019s production derives from 18 large fields, 9 of which are classifiable as giant fields. Essentially all of Russia\u2019s production derives from 36 giant fields. The findings show that there is little potential for an increase in the level of Norwegian gas exports to the EU. All of the scenarios studied indicate that Norwegian gas production will be in decline by 2030, by which year Norwegian gas deliveries to the EU via pipeline may have fallen by as much as 20 per cent from today\u2019s level. Additionally, a study of potential production from Russian giant fields indicates a maximum increase of 45 per cent in the level of Russian gas exports to the EU by 2030. In absolute terms, this corresponds to approximately 70 (Gm3) Gm3/year by the year 2025, and around 50 (Gm3) Gm3/year by the year 2030. By the year 2025, Russian gas deliveries to the EU will be approximately 30 per cent higher than in 2006, of which some 60 per cent will be transported via pipeline. The amount of Russian energy delivered to the EU via pipeline will also increase significantly during the period from 2010 to 2030. The total gas volumes transported via pipeline will have increased by more than 100 per cent during the same period. However, the study demonstrates that in no scenario studied does an increase in the quantity or quality of Russian gas deliveries to the EU have a major effect on domestic gas prices. On the contrary, the study indicates that for gas producers with large reserves the higher volumes and improved quality of deliveries to the EU lead to increased prices and increased demand. <sent> However, the study shows that the level of Russian gas imports to the EU will remain a major issue for the EU.

Paramount is releasing the film in the exact same corridor that brought success in the last couple of years to two other, somewhat similar movies American Sniper and Lone Survivor, and like the latter film in particular, Bay has crafted a patriotic, riveting war movie full of intense action that also thankfully puts a human face on exactly what happened in Benghazi.\nretired Navy Seals and Marines now in their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, is basically a movie that puts its emphasis on the brave men who fought this battle rather than the ensuing political storm it is still causing as we enter this Presidential election year. Hillary Clinton and President Obama (not even mentioned) are not the focus here as in the political debate about what was done \u2013 or not done- in this incident.

What ensues is a very violent war film full of shooting and explosions, exactly the kind of thing we have come to expect from Bay films, but here in the context of a true story seems all too real, putting the audience right in the center of the action.\nIn many ways this movie, which really only wants to focus on the warrior, not the war, is like many others, but because it is likely to be used as a political football (and already has been on Fox News) the real point of it could be sadly lost. I hope it isn\u2019t because seeing this whole thing from the POV of the men who were on the front lines, much like The Alamo in some ways (there\u2019s even a reference to that), is compelling moviemaking and a real step forward into something a little more important than another Transformers movie for Bay.\nThe acting across the board is excellent with standouts being John Krasinski as a former Navy Seal who must abandon his family just one more time to take on an assignment he thought would be brief and uneventful.

{"prefix": "Law enforcement officers, including a sniper perched atop an armored vehicle, watch as demonstrators protest the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo., Aug. 13, 2014. The police chief of this St. Louis suburb said Wednesday that Brown injured the officer who later fatally shot the unarmed 18 year old though witnesses dispute that such an altercation occurred.\nAfter delivering remarks last night from the White House, President Obama fielded some questions from reporters and made a comment that stood out for me. \u201c[T]he vast majority of the community [in Ferguson] has been working very hard to try to make sure that this becomes an opportunity for us to seize the moment and turn this into a positive situation,\u201d he said.\nIt sounded like a nice-but-unrealistic goal. Years of systemic problems contributed to these crisis conditions, and the idea of turning the Michael Brown tragedy into something constructive is hard to fathom.\nThat said, over the summer, there was a fair amount of interest in one specific area: the militarization of local law enforcement. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) chaired a Senate hearing in September, and reforms to the Pentagon\u2019s \u201c1033\u201d program were endorsed by some Republicans, including Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). In the House, Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) drafted legislation.\nSo what happened? Part of the problem is the political world\u2019s short attention span.

The police chief of this St. Louis suburb said Wednesday that Brown injured the officer who later fatally shot the unarmed 18 year old though witnesses dispute that such an altercation occurred. After delivering remarks last night from the White House, President Obama fielded some questions from reporters and made a comment that stood out for me. \u201c[T]he vast majority of the community [in Ferguson] has been working very hard to try to make sure that this becomes an opportunity for us to seize the moment and turn this into a positive situation,\u201d he said. It sounded like a nice-but-unrealistic goal. Years of systemic problems contributed to these crisis conditions, and the idea of turning the Michael Brown tragedy into something constructive is hard to fathom.

Now, this button right here lets you move through various dpi settings you can make the most more less sensitive as you're playing. You can also use the included driver's software to customize the settings, so you can really tweak and feel the mouse to exactly how you would like it, if you flip it over, you can see it done.

That's actually a nice little feature and it really helps improve the overall feel of the mouse.

Area roads were buried under mud and blocked by big boulders. So a Coast Guard crew was dispatched about 6:15 a.m. from the Los Angeles/Long Beach base on an MH-65 Dolphin helicopter usually used for rescues at sea.

{"prefix": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The senator leading the charge to revive a assault weapons ban conceded on Sunday, just days before hearings on gun control open, that winning Senate passage will be tough but said she has been assured she will have the chance to bring it up for a vote.\nPresident Barack Obama, who has made gun control a top priority after 20 children and six adults were killed by a gunman on December 14 at a Connecticut school, said in remarks published on Sunday that gun control advocates should take into account the views of rural Americans who use guns for hunting.\n\u201cPart of being able to move this forward is understanding the reality of guns in urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural areas,\u201d Obama told The New Republic magazine as he continued his administration\u2019s outreach to gun owners even as he seeks new gun restrictions.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein said Majority Leader Harry Reid has promised that even if the assault weapons ban is left out of a broader package intended to curb gun violence, she will have the opportunity to offer it as an amendment on the Senate floor.\nFeinstein introduced legislation last Thursday to ban military-style assault weapons like the one used by the gunman in last month\u2019s school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and high-capacity ammunition clips.\n\u201cThis has always been an uphill fight.

President Barack Obama, who has made gun control a top priority after 20 children and six adults were killed by a gunman on December 14 at a Connecticut school, said in remarks published on Sunday that gun control advocates should take into account the views of rural Americans who use guns for hunting. \u201cPart of being able to move this forward is understanding the reality of guns in urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural areas,\u201d Obama told The New Republic magazine as he continued his administration\u2019s outreach to gun owners even as he seeks new gun restrictions. Senator Dianne Feinstein said Majority Leader Harry Reid has promised that even if the assault weapons ban is left out of a broader package intended to curb gun violence, she will have the opportunity to offer it as an amendment on the Senate floor. Feinstein introduced legislation last Thursday to ban military-style assault weapons like the one used by the gunman in last month\u2019s school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and high-capacity ammunition clips. \u201cThis has always been an uphill fight. This has never been easy. This is the hardest of the hard,\u201d Feinstein, a California Democrat, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d program. \u201cNow, will it (gun violence legislation) only be assault weapons? No, most likely. There will be a package put together. If assault weapons is left out of the package...

{"prefix": "Not every 79-year-old surgeon happens to run a tech incubator. Not every 79-year-old surgeon who runs a tech incubator happens to have a winery either. But Thomas Fogarty does. The doctor-entrepreneur-vintner, best known for inventing the angioplasty balloon, runs the Thomas Fogarty Winery just a few miles uphill from his medtech incubator at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View.\nThe non-profit Fogarty Institute for Innovation is based around a simple concept: Making life easier for small or early stage medtech firms developing cutting-edge products or tools. In an interview with Fast Company, Fogarty decried what he saw as the increasing cost of American medical innovation, and said that small medical companies need a safe environment for growth similar to those of lower-overhead conventional tech startups.\nSince its founding in 2007, the Institute has helped about a dozen small medical companies launch. Back in June, the Institute announced its latest crop of participants. The five new companies are primarily centered around providing services for expectant parents or newborn children. Among them are a non-invasive sensor that records fetal vital signs, a device that prevents vaginal tearing during childbirth, and a sensor set for clinicians giving urgent care to newborns.\nFirst Pulse Medical: First Pulse manufactures one of the first attempts at a heart rate monitor for fetuses during labor and delivery. The monitor uses proprietary light sensors to track a fetus's heart rate and oxygenation.\nInPress Technologies: InPress is testing a single-use medical device which quickly and effectively treats postpartum hemorrhaging (PPH) as it happens by stimulating vaginal contractions. One woman dies from PPH every four minutes.\nMaterna Medical: Materna is conducting tests in Australia on an anti-vaginal tearing device for women giving birth. The mechanical dilator is inserted during the first stage of labor and is designed to prevent vaginal tearing or pelvic damage during childbirth.\nMedical Cue: Medical Cue's NeoCue system is a combination sensor set/workflow organizing tool for childbirth. The system automatically gives medical professionals key physiologic data and real-time decision guidance.\nPrescient Surgical: Prescient Surgical's Cleancision device prevents dangerous surgical wound infections. This Stanford University spin-off is targeting a very specific market--obese patients undergoing colorectal surgery.\nDuring our conversation, which jumped from Fogarty's anger at the press for publishing (in his opinion) to many scare stories about medical innovation to the interaction between his institute and the larger Silicon Valley tech scene, he said something interesting. \u201cThe venture capital community has largely avoided medical companies because of the expenses associated with it. There are also many other problems, but primarily they're regulatory. We need more clinical research [for products] in addition to basic research... What we're doing at the Institute is trying to solve these issues.\" Fogarty also added that the institute works with entrepreneurs in other highly regulated industries to trade best practices on navigating bureaucracy, which is a common hurdle for health startups.\nThere are fewer industries more highly regulated than the medical profession. While transport apps like Uber have to deal with byzantine local taxi bureaucracies, medical startups face the FDA--an organization that is both costly and inefficient to deal with. Fogarty, along with many other biotech innovators I've spoken to, complains that the FDA is inefficient when it comes to evaluating new technology. It's not that the FDA is hostile to innovation; rather, it's that agency bureaucrats don't keep up with new research.\nWhat the Fogarty Institute tries to do is to make the regulatory and fundraising parts of getting off the ground easier for young medtech firms. Participating companies in the Innovation Cultivation incubator base themselves at the Institute and are given assistance with research", "gen_completion": " and pilot projects. The institute also has its own in-house FDA lab, where companies can run clinical trials that are usually conducted out of the public eye. The Institute is funded by private donations, though, Fogarty says that there's less interest from the venture capital community to pitch in than tech firms do. The problem, says Fogarty, is that the healthcare industry tends to be more conservative than other sectors, and a lot of Silicon Valley VCs tend to avoid investment in entrepreneurs that don't have funding already. The recent loss of Michael Moritz to the Mayo Clinic doesn't help.\nGiven all of this experience, Fogarty says that the best way to encourage medical innovation is to encourage medical research. The medical tech community has largely been too conservative, for what it's worth. \u201cWe have to get out more and get more creative. A lot of the innovation happens in the labs,\u201d Fogarty says. \u201cWe have to have a better attitude about what", "paraphrase_outputs": {"lex_40_order_100": {"final_input": "lexical = 40, order = 100 Not every 79-year-old surgeon happens to run a tech incubator. Not every 79-year-old surgeon who runs a tech incubator happens to have a winery either. But Thomas Fogarty does. The doctor-entrepreneur-vintner, best known for inventing the angioplasty balloon, runs the Thomas Fogarty Winery just a few miles uphill from his medtech incubator at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View. The non-profit Fogarty Institute for Innovation is based around a simple concept: Making life easier for small or early stage medtech firms developing cutting-edge products or tools. In an interview with Fast Company, Fogarty decried what he saw as the increasing cost of American medical innovation, and said that small medical companies need a safe environment for growth similar to those of lower-overhead conventional tech startups. Since its founding in 2007, the Institute has helped about a dozen small medical companies launch. Back in June, the Institute announced its latest crop of participants. The five new companies are primarily centered around providing services for expectant parents or newborn children. Among them are a non-invasive sensor that records fetal vital signs, a device that prevents vaginal tearing during childbirth, and a sensor set for clinicians giving urgent care to newborns. First Pulse Medical: First Pulse manufactures one of the first attempts at a heart rate monitor for fetuses during labor and delivery. The monitor uses proprietary light sensors to track a fetus's heart rate and oxygenation. InPress Technologies: InPress is testing a single-use medical device which quickly and effectively treats postpartum hemorrhaging (PPH) as it happens by stimulating vaginal contractions. One woman dies from PPH every four minutes. Materna Medical: Materna is conducting tests in Australia on an anti-vaginal tearing device for women giving birth. The mechanical dilator is inserted during the first stage of labor and is designed to prevent vaginal tearing or pelvic damage during childbirth. Medical Cue: Medical Cue's NeoCue system is a combination sensor set/workflow organizing tool for childbirth. The system automatically gives medical professionals key physiologic data and real-time decision guidance. Prescient Surgical: Prescient Surgical's Cleancision device prevents dangerous surgical wound infections. This Stanford University spin-off is targeting a very specific market--obese patients undergoing colorectal surgery. During our conversation, which jumped from Fogarty's anger at the press for publishing (in his opinion) to many scare stories about medical innovation to the interaction between his institute and the larger Silicon Valley tech scene, he said something interesting. \u201cThe venture capital community has largely avoided medical companies because of the expenses associated with it. There are also many other problems, but primarily they're regulatory. We need more clinical research [for products] in addition to basic research... What we're doing at the Institute is trying to solve these issues.\" Fogarty also added that the institute works with entrepreneurs in other highly regulated industries to trade best practices on navigating bureaucracy, which is a common hurdle for health startups. There are fewer industries more highly regulated than the medical profession. While transport apps like Uber have to deal with byzantine local taxi bureaucracies, medical startups face the FDA--an organization that is both costly and inefficient to deal with. Fogarty, along with many other biotech innovators I've spoken to, complains that the FDA is inefficient when it comes to evaluating new technology. It's not that the FDA is hostile to innovation; rather, it's that agency bureaucrats don't keep up with new research. What the Fogarty Institute tries to do is to make the regulatory and fundraising parts of getting off the ground easier for young medtech firms. Participating companies in the Innovation Cultivation incubator base themselves at the Institute and are given assistance with research projects, fundraising, and regulatory compliance. The Institute also has its own on-site FDA-compliant clinical testing lab, where companies can conduct clinical trials. According to Fogarty, however, the venture capital community is less keen on contributing to medical innovation than the tech community. What he sees as the underlying problem is that the medical industry is more conservative than the tech industry, and a number of VCs in the valley are wary of investing in unproven companies. The recent loss of Mayo Clinic\u2019s scion, Michael Moore, doesn\u2019t help. Using his own experience, Fogarty says the best way to promote medical innovation is to encourage research. On the whole, medical innovators are too conservative. \u201cWe need to be more outwardly focused and creative...

One such dispersal order was put in place following the stabbing of a 15-year-old boy in the city centre on Sunday, February 2. This meant officers could move on any groups hanging around in the city centre if it\u2019s suspected they could be a crime or anti-social behaviour threat. If those moved along came back, then they faced possibly being arrested. Coventry stabbing reaction: \"Where are the parents?\" The teenager was found with knife injuries to his leg and lower torso in Trinity Street shortly before 6pm and was taken to hospital. His injuries were not life-changing and he was released from hospital just hours later. Dispersal orders are not a new action that police can take, however they aren&apos;t always used. So we asked the Commander of Coventry Police, Chief Superintendent Mike O&apos;Hara, why one was used on Sunday and what came of it. Q: Why was this stabbing deemed serious enough to put the dispersal order in place? A: The stabbing was deemed serious enough by the duty Inspector on the evening to put the order in place, due to the fact that groups were congregating in the area. The groups soon dispersed following increased police presence in the area. Q: Was the order actually used by officers on Sunday or Monday to move anyone along or did it result in any arrests? A: I cannot confirm at this stage the specific details of the use of the order, however, previous use of the dispersal power has proven very effective in removing problematic individuals from the city centre and preventing potential issues. Officers have utilised search powers on numerous individuals in the area resulting in a drugs arrest. Q: Is the use of dispersal orders something you are now considering using more often in the wake of incidents like this? A: The use of the dispersal power is a very useful tool for officers in dealing with groups of youths when they feel that the criteria apply and the St Michaels areas are deemed unsafe. I have no doubt that if we applied the power more consistently across the city, it would have a significant impact on keeping the city centre clean, safe and free from criminal intent. However, it is a time-consuming process and it takes time for the police to return to an area to enforce it. We have also used the power in the past to move on groups of individuals, rather than focus on those who have committed a crime. Q: How did the 15-year-old boy come to be stabbed?

One aspect of this new relationship is the recent announcement by the federal budget committee that it had voted to table a motion of no confidence in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In other words, we no longer are a minority government. <sent> While there will come times when we may not agree, we shall stick together in these challenging times. Last October our riding\u2019s residents showed their unity, strength and a desire to form government at the polls but also by continuing to cast their ballot for the NDP. By doing both, our riding set a new record for NDP MPs in Canada, taking over the record set by former NDP Leader Jack Layton in 2006. </sent>", "output": ["under my leadership, and am so thankful for the many issues that have been brought to the attention of our committee by the people I represent, especially the people of Thunder Bay-Rainy River and the three surrounding ridings.

US gold futures for December also touched a low since August 9 at $1,304.60 an ounce and stood at $1313.50,still down $17.40. \"This is almost certainly the pricing in of the expectations of QE tapering,\" Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said. \"The FOMC is meeting next week and there is a great deal of speculation over the beginning of the end as far as QE is concerned as soon as the end of the month of whatever size that might be,\" he added. The US Federal Reserve may announce a cut in its $85 billion monthly bond purchases at the end of its two-day meeting on Sept. 18. Gold lost 19 percent this year after the Fed signalled it would start reining in nearly five years of quantitative easing that weighed the dollar down and encouraged investors to buy hard and non-interest rate bearing assets like gold. Gold were under pressure from a firmer dollar ahead of US retail sales and sentiment data due later on Friday, which could further weigh on sentiment if they come in above market expectations. Gold prices rallied above $1,430 an ounce to a three-and-a-half-month high in late August on safe-haven buying as the United States and its allies looked set to launch military strikes on Syria. But the metal's appeal has been dented by diplomatic efforts to place Syria's chemical weapons under international control,which may avert a US military strike.Physical dealers reported on Friday there was very little buying interest. \"There is not much interest here,\" said a Singapore-based dealer, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Gold fell in Asian trade on Friday, with fears of a US-led strike on Syria and the prospect of new sanctions against Iran, erasing recent optimism about a diplomatic resolution. \"The dollar is still trading above its 200-day moving average, which is at $1,312.50,\" the dealer said. <sent> US gold for December delivery slipped $10 </sent>", "output": ["on Friday there was very little buying interest. \"There is not much interest here,\" said a Singapore-based dealer, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
